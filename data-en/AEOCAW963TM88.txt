How well I remember walking out of the theatre in 1976

and looking up at the sky as if it were a living thing

CE3K remains a beautiful metaphor for all that is unknown

For many of us

the first question will be

\"Did Steven ditch that interior of the Mothership

\" Happily

it was the first cut he made

All the good stuff is here

edited more tightly by an admittedly older and less credulous director

Yet despite his avowed \"maturity\" (read skepticism)

his Director's Cut is delicious

loving

and as full of wonder as ever

I know this is unpopular: I love Spielberg for his lyricism

his poetry

and his willingness to take us \"out there

\" \"Private Ryan\" was quite well-made

I've never gotten through Schindler

But in CE3K

ET

Jurassic Park

Always and others

Steven has shown me things I've always wanted to see

Though much of his industry recognition has come from his more recent work

it's always been his forays into fantasy that seemed so redolent of truth to me

In the Director's Cut

he shows that the boy within the man is still alive and luminous

Dreyfuss has never had a better turn (arguable

admittedly

when one thinks of \"Mr

Holland's Opus

\" a more mature tour-de-force for him) and Melinda Dillon is the ultimate feminine archetype

Can't recommend this highly enough

The decision to split the newer \"extras\" into three parts

across the DVDs is inconvenient

and a small matter in the face of this wonderful release

And if you like that dreadful UFO interior

it's on the second DVD

Enjoy
