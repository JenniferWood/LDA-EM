I liked this movie

except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph

and he has a hard time resisting at first

whereas

Biblically

I think he was stronger than that

I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher

Because of the scene mentioned

I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it

But

other than that

it was done excellently
