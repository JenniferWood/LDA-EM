It's ironic that \"Character\" won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film the same year that \"Titanic\" won for Best Picture

\"Character\" makes \"Titanic\" look like a grade-school production of \"Gilligan's Island

\" One of the most powerful films I've ever seen

it was painful and difficult to watch

and absolutely brilliant

With not a false note anywhere

the epic scope of the story

the acting and the cinematography drew me in and broke my heart

Not to be missed
