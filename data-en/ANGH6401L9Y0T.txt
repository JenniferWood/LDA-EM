I've tried to read it several times

and this is the second movie I've seen of it

but I realize now that I understood very little about the story until now

This is by far the most lucid interpretation of the story that I have seen

Also it's just plain well done in all respects

which can't hurt a bit

Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) was jailed at hard labor for 19 years for stealing food

(Traditionally a loaf of bread

but it may have been two or three loaves

) When he is finally released

he begs a night's lodging from a priest

then steals the priest's silver spoons the next morning

When he is caught

he claims the priest gave him the silver

The gendarmes return him to the priest and he says yes

that's right

I gave them to him

but why did you forget the candlesticks

After the police leave

Valjean and the priest talk about why the priest had protected Valjean

and the priest reminds Valjean that he had said he would become a new man

Fast forward five years

and he has indeed become a new man

He has purchased a mill in a small town

instituted reforms in the management of the mill

and become the mayor of the town

One day

Inspector Jovert (Geoffrey Rush) shows up and it's not long before he recognizes Valjean (who has changed his name

of course) as one of the prisoners he guarded when he spent a year as a prison guard some while back

From this point

the underlying theme of the movie is the deadly game of hide and seek played out by Jovert and Valjean

But there are many

many other plot threads

Fantine (Uma Thurman) worked in Valjean's mill

but was fired when it was discovered that she had an illegitimate child who was being cared for by other people

and she begs for her job because she needs to buy medicine for the child

Cosette

In fact

she is being ripped off by the innkeeper and his wife who are boarding the child

and they are also using the child for slave labor

Anyway

the story of how Valean gets involved in Fantine's life and death

and then Cosette's life

is complicated and needs to be told in its own way

Suffice to say he promises Fantine on her death bed that he will take care of Cosette

and he does

He rescues the child Cosette and takes her with him to Paris

where they have to sneak in because they have no papers

Once again we fast forward until Cosette is a beautiful young lady (Claire Danes) who is understood to be Valjean's daughter

Unfortunately

she falls in love with a radical named Marius (Hans Matheson)

who is right in the middle of plotting a revolution

And then it REALLY gets complicated

It's a good story and a good movie

See it
