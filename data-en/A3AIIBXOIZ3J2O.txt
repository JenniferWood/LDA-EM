This movie is famous for Tom Hank's character Jimmy Dugan(Rockford Peaches coach) saying &quot;There's no crying in baseball

&quot; And that would be right if we weren't talking about the women's baseball league

I thought that this movie truly was interesting from a historical perpective on the women's game and also a movie that made you both laugh and cry

It was an amazing story of struggle

love

sorrow

and joy

I would recommend this movie to those who want to laugh and cry and basically if you are curious about what women in baseball was all about

My hats off to the real athletes for paving the way for my generation and what a great tribute
