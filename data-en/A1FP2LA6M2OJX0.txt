I was one of the people who saw this in its original form and

unlike it's cousin The Muppet Family Christmas

it survived the editing process with only minor resections

However

it boggles my mind why they removed Kermit's narration towards the end of the show

It is quite obvious where they did it because Emmet freeze frames for a few seconds and then it abruptly segways into them singing together

Oh well

I have loved this one since I first saw it on HBO in the late 80's

This is a good example of how a good story survives

no matter how low-tech its presentation is

It is nice to have it on DVD

even with the alterations

Merry Christmas
