This box set of Close Encounters contains 3 diffeent versions of the film

The original theatrical edition

the special edition

and the director's cut

It also comes with a movie timeline that shows tells the differences between the 3 versions

the original motion picture soundtrack

and a collectors edition booklet

The movie timeline is reversable

on the other side it becomes a movies poster

It's glossy and well put together

The box is pretty thick and well made also

I haven't seen a more comprehensive Close Encounters box set

If you are planning to buy this legendary movie this edition is stacked and well worth the money
