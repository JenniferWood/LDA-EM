This bluray edition of the package is the one to get as it has all 3 versions of the film (theatrical

TV release version

and the Spielberg preferred director's cut along with a very informative \"poster\" where the movie flow timelines for all 3 versions are shown and compared

It is great to see and hear Spielberg (both then and now) and appreciate what a creative genius he is

The bluray presents a great picture and the sound stage is as immersive as I remember it when I saw this movie as a child
