I just finished watching this film for the umpteenth time and it occured to me how special this film is

Not only did Penny Marshall give us a fun heartfelt sports film

she gave us one of the best movies in the last few decades

It is a shame that most people just regard it as a feel good sports movie

and not one of the best pictures in recent history

Not a single acadamy award nod was given to this film

which is a great shame for such a wonderful picture

The casting was dead on from Geena Davis to Madonna

everyone made their part believable

but it is without a doubt that Tom Hanks gave the movie it's brilliance

He is undoubtedly one of the silver screens greatest actors and can portray any part given to him

The story is based on the real events of a woman's baseball league during WWII

Though not a documentary

it is very realistic and believable

You get plenty of laughs and cheers

as well as a few tears in this modern day classic

Definatley one of the 50 best films ever made
