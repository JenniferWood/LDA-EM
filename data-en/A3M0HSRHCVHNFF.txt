I thought I'd give this another view after so many years to see if the older me might like it better

It's still just okay

It's a hopeful movie about how we might encounter alien beings but the story still doesn't resonate with me

The effects are dated (1977)

Some parts are a technically inaccurate

like giant dark shadow being cast by a hovering

brightly lit giant spaceship





at night
