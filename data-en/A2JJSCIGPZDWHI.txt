I am not the biggest fan of Spielberg

He might be thought of as one of Hollywood's sacred cows

but not everything he's done has turned to gold

A regrettable example of that would be





Batteries Not Included in 1987

He has done his share of stinkers as well

but Close Encounters of the Third Kind

even more so than E

T



in my opinion

is his crowning achievement

I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood (I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977)

Trust me on this

this is one creepy film

Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night

giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO

Enough has been already said of the film that hasn't been already said

The film involves Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil's Tower in Wyoming

which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie (Teri Garr)

Devil's Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens

There are at least a couple of versions of this film

There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that's it

And then there's the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to

I have seen both versions

so I should know

When you're younger

you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end (which look very similar to the &quot;Greys&quot; that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens)

When you're older

you'll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil's Tower was evacuated (truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell's radio program)

It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert

those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 (several months after WWII ended)

If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s

Close Encounters was truly that one movie

I am not much for Hollywood movies

because so much of it is so hyped and commercialized

or so mediocre

but this is truly amazing and needs to be seen
