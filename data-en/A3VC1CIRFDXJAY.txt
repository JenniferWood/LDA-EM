This movie is almost like the story of Joseph

thats written in the Bible

Joseph was a remarkable man

If only the leaders of the world today was like Joseph was

a wise man

who listened to God

and kept the Ten Commandments

Please read God's story of Joseph

thats in the book of Geneis

in the Holy Bible first

so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand

This is a awesome

and remarkable true story

of so long ago

My favorite part of the movie

is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face

WOW

This movie was very well done

this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph

God blessed Joseph greatly

and had big plans for him all along

for living his life as a godly man

I loved the way Joseph

and his Egyption master(Ben Kingsley)

became friends

and earned each others trust and respect

eventhough Joseph was still a slave

It always amazed me

how Joseph was able to forgive his brothers

especially after what they did to him

Joseph was a very wise

and brillant man

I highly recommend this movie

it is based on a very true

and awesome story

thats in the HOLY BIBLE

This movie is very good

and I loved it very much

You will end up watching it more than once
