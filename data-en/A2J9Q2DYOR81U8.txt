This film is the combination of everything good about movies--action

conflict

romance

comedy

it is a well-written film that is also well-directed and well-acted

The casting is amazing and the soundtrack to the film is great (get it if you get the chance)

My friends know to call me when this movie airs on TV

It's funny because my phone will ring throughout the airing of the film

I love this movie

Aside form the fabulous performances by Tom Hanks and Geena Davis

Lori petty

Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna give very good performances

as well

I highly recommend this movie to all viewers

There is only one instance in the movie that parents may want to be careful if watching with children

Tom Hanks' character says \"sh**\" once in the film but other than that

nothing else is too objectionable
