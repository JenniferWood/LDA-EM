Two soldiers

one American

one Japanese

trapped together alone on a small Pacific island during WWII

What will happen

Very interesting character study with irrational and inventive clashes

and forced compromises

with superbly acting and nice cinematography

Up until very near the end I really liked it

but unfortunately I found the climax very open-ended and weak

Too bad

it was a great story with no real ending

But with images and performances so memorable

Thumbs up
