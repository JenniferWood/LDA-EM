Wow

pinch me









I must be dreaming

This is a Grade A exhibit of how you can still make a terrific movie today without profanity

tons of violence and/or sex









AND how you can make a picture which carries a good

moral message

This is one of truly rare modern-day films that actually espouses mercy and forgiveness instead of revenge

This is simply a solid film with a very satisfying ending







satisfying to people who aren't in love with edgy

nasty endings









such as almost all your professional movie critics

So

if your favorite critic didn't give this film a good review - and most did not - please ignore it

In addition to the involving storyline and excellent acting by Liam Neeson

Geoffrey Rush

Uma Thurman and Claire Danes

the viewer is treated to some beautiful European countryside scenery

My only complaint of this film is the shoddy treatment it received on DVD

No extras and so-so sharpness

Like the movie itself

it deserves more respect

Hopefully

a Blu-Ray will come out and give us the sharp transfer this film deserves
