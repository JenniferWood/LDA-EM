What more need be said about this other than that it is a film by Spielberg

the insipid director who brought us such films as \"Always\" or \"Hook\"

other than that he is the worst filmmaker since Bill Rebane

This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent

half-hearted efforts

This film is an incredibly boring

almost plotless

overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death

Also

a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century

We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk

If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS

For your next release

try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk

At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid
