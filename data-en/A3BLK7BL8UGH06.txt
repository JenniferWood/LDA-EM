doug [nicolas cage] is an fbi agent assigned to guard tess [shirley mclaine] a widowed

former first lady

he is a rules and regulations guy with no spontaniety

she is a free spirit with little tolerance for the fbi's button-down world

prior to being assigned to tess

doug worked under her husband

the president

one day while watching videotape of her husband's funeral

tess sees doug become emotional

a rare opportunity to see him vulnerable

it's obvious they have more in common than at first glance

doug is tested later and comes to realize he cares for her very much

great movie

with a lot of heart and humanity
