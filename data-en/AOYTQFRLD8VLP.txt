Penny Marshall's 1992 directorial offering introduced many to a forgotten chapter of American Sports History: The creation of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League in response to the man shortage caused by World War II

This event culminates to a point in the story that begins decades later when the recently widowed Dottie Hinson(Lynn Cartwright)is persuaded by her daughter

Margaret(Blaine Baron) to attend the opening of a museum exhibit honoring the women of the League

After some misgivings

she agrees to go

but as she leaves

she warns her older grandson

Jeffrey(Ryan Howell) to let his younger brother

Bobby(Brian Boru Gleeson) get a few shots in during their basketball game because he is smaller and has less of an advantage

To her younger

scrappier grandson

she gives even more practical advice based on her own experience with sibling rivalry:\"Kill him

\"As she is en route to the reunion

we travel back in time to the early 1940s where Dottie is a young farm wife(Geena Davis) who works at a local dairy

helps out on her family farm

and along with her younger sister

Kit(Lori Petty)

plays baseball on the Lukash Dairy team while awaiting her husband's return from the war

After playing a game in which Dottie wins the day

Kit laments her lost chance at being the heroine

and as well as constantly playing second fiddle to her older sister

But their fates are about to change

Ernie Capadino(Jon Lovitz)

a talent scout who saw the game offers Dottie a chance to try out for the League

Initially reluctant to accept based on the conditions

she is prodded to do so by Kit

who has been denied the same offer because of her failure to impress Capadino during the game

Capadino agrees to let Kit come only if Dottie comes with her

Eager to leave Oregon because she sees no future in staying where she is

Kit does convince her sister to come along

and both meet the train out of town the next morning

They suffer Capadino's crudeness all the way to Colorado

where they encounter Marla Hooch(Megan Cavanagh)

whose father

Dave(Eddie Jones)

is a baseball coach

She proves to be a fantastic hitter

but is nearly rejected by Capadino because he considers her unattractive

The protestations of Kit and Dottie make him change his mind

As Capadino delivers the recruits at Wrigley Field

we hear the criticism of social commentator

Maida Gillespie(Laurel Cronin)

who objects to candy bar company/baseball club owner

Walter Harvey's (Garry Marshall-whose real-life counterpart was chewing gum manufacturer Phillip Wrigley)\"masculinization\" of women by \"plucking girls from their homes\" for this pursuit

which she claims is \"detrimental to the home

the children the family

and the country\"

The Maida Gillespies of this world have to be forgiven for being products of their time

As our story further unfolds

we see how this groundbreaking feat gives young women an opportunity for growth they otherwise may not have had

Ann Cusack's Shirley Baker

whose illiteracy nearly cost her her chance to be on the Rockford Peaches' team learns to read

the tough New Yorkers

Mae Mordabito(Madonna) and Doris Murphy(Rosie O'Donnell)

become slightly more refined

and have a chance for a more respectable job than the ones they held previously

and when Doris severs ties with a boyfriend who mistreats her

we see how girls' involvement in sports makes them less tolerant of abusive relationships

Don Davis' Charlie Collins

coach of the Racine Belles

initiates those accepted for the various teams

along with pitchman Ira Lowenstein(David Straithairn)

To coach the Rockford Peaches

Harvey recruits former Baseball great

Jimmy Dugan(Tom Hanks--whose real-life-counterpart is Jimmy Foxx)

whose career took a nosedive due to his alcoholism

but who has enough star power to attract a crowd

Dugan is extremely apprehensive about the venture due to Neanderthal views of the opposite sex

But little does he realize how a working relationship with women will change him forever

To appease social critics

the young women take etiquette lessons

and beautify themselves

Even then

when Ellie Weingardt's charm school instructor

inspects her students in a lineup

she is more complimentary of Dottie than of Kit

who is at least spared her thumbs-down review of shy and homely

Marla

who will blossom in due time

Other players include

left-fielder

Betty \"Spaghetti\" Horn(Marshall's daughter

Tracy Reiner)

a charismatic and assertive 1st basewoman

Helen Hayley (Anne Ramsay)

the superstitious left-and centerfielder

Alice Gaspers(Renee Coleman)

Kelly Simkins' outfielder

Beverly Dixon

Freddie Simpson's ex-Miss Georgia and current shortstop

Ellen Sue Gotlander

and Bitty Schram's right-fielder/pitcher

Evelyn Gardner

who is compelled to bring her hellion son Stilwell(Justin Scheller) with her on the cross-country trek

yet manages to write a song honoring the League

Pauline Brailsford's Miss Cuthbert is the team's chaperone

who monitors her charges during church services

pleads fruitlessly with an irate bus driver pushed over the edge by Stilwell's antics

endures insults and backside slaps from Dugan

has her dinner poisoned by Mae so the girls can slip out and go to a bar

and comforts a young player who learns the grim fate of a husband fighting in the Pacific via telegram

Dugan's initial meeting with the players is less than cordial

In reality the women would not have stood for his crude antics and would have bodily thrown him out of the locker room

Dottie again takes charge when Dugan fails to give them a lineup during their first game(which he is too soused to watch although the announcer gives him credit for the team's performance)

During their first game

the camera pans the line of nervous women facing a less-than friendly crowd

amid beauty pageant contestant Ellen Sue's advice

\"Just keep smiling

\" It will be her fastball that knocks a heckler(Joe Krowka) back in line as she gives the coy explanation that \"It slipped

\"

retaining feminine modesty despite aggression

Tensions increase between Dottie and Kit when the latter still finds herself in her sister's shadow

amid the news that Mr

Harvey may discontinue the League if Lowenstein can't find a way to save it

The ultimate result is Kit's being traded to Racine

knowing that her sister is considered a better player and those in charge would never trade their precious \"Queen of Diamonds\"

A moment of locker room camaraderie is shattered when one of the kindest players

who

like may women with spouses away at war

did her best to keep up morale

receives her husband's death notice and Dottie realizes how close she came to being the recipient of that telegram

But fortune turns in her favor and she decides to return to Oregon despite chastisement by Dugan

Her return to play in the World Series will lead to a stunning climax

Watch for Tea Leoni in a supporting role

and Michael Hayley as an empathetic umpire

who encourages Dugan to soften his manner in dealing with the ladies

A few of Marshall's \"Laverne and Shirley\" co-stars make cameo appearances-- David L

Lander as an announcer

and Eddie Mekka as a soldier in a bar

Marshall's niece

Kathleen is one of the ball players

Gradually

Dottie arrives at the reunion amid moments of comedy and poignancy

as does Kit (Kathleen Butler) who brings her spouse

children

and grandchildren to the Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit

happy and on an equal footing with Dottie at last

The sentimentality of those old ladies is truly endearing

and they still play ball with the same spark of fire they had in their youth

Nearly a decade earlier \"Swing Shift\" told the story of how women stoked the fires of the industrial homefront

\"A League of Their Own\" brilliantly depicts how women of that era kept baseball--that staple of American sports-- afloat

adding dimension to their own lives

paving the way for future female athletes

and earning the respect of the men who worked with them
