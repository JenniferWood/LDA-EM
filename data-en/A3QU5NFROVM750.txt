WKRP in Cincinnati on home video

A great idea

as this was a consistently well-written show

and one of the more intelligent ones from its era

but New Video has done the show an injustice by:A

Releasing only eight episodesB

Using masters with the original rock music used during the network run replaced by stock musicC

At times

resorting to substandard and/or edited copies

Now that 20th Century Fox Home Video owns the rights to this and the rest of the MTM Productions library

it is time to beg them for a DVD release of all 90 episodes unedited and with the original music restored
