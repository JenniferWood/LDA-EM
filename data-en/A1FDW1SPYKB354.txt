The 2-Disc DVD Special Edition of 1992's &quot;A League Of Their Own&quot; (released on April 20

2004) scores a grand-slam on my DVD Scorecard

Sporting a fun array of bonus features

a beautiful anamorphically-enhanced widescreen picture

and very clever menu screens

this DVD version of this timeless motion picture is a winner all the way around

Although the film has a relatively-lengthy run time of 2 hours &amp; 8 minutes

it never wears out its welcome or gets tiresome

The first-rate cast sees to that -- a cast that features the likes of Tom Hanks

Geena Davis

Madonna

Rosie O'Donnell

Lori Petty

and Jon Lovitz

Lovitz is fall-down hilarious as the scout who plucks Geena and Lori off of their Oregon farm to join the first professional girls' baseball league

He offers up one zinger after another during his short stint in this movie

such as his explanation to the other girls as to why he can't sign up second baseman Marla Hooch (who isn't likely to win the Miss America Pageant anytime soon) -- &quot;You know General Omar Bradley

Well

there's too strong a resemblance

&quot;DVD Special Features for the 2-Disc &quot;Special Edition&quot;



























&gt;&gt; A very nice 52-minute documentary on the making of the film

&quot;Nine Memorable Innings&quot;

featuring new interviews with the cast and crew

and some behind-the-scenes footage

&gt;&gt; 15 Deleted Scenes

Many of these cut scenes flesh out some of the movie's shorter scenes

Some very interesting stuff here too

You can play each of these scenes separately

or via a &quot;Play All&quot; option

And these can be played with or without a &quot;Director's Introduction&quot; preceding each clip from Penny Marshall

Total run time: 36:02 with intros

or 32:39 without them

&gt;&gt; Commentary Track

with Director Penny Marshall and some of the cast members

&gt;&gt; 3 Trailers -- Including the excellent and funny trailer for this movie

plus bonus trailers for two other sports films (&quot;Brian's Song&quot; and &quot;The Natural&quot;)

&gt;&gt; Madonna Music Video -- &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; (run time: 5:02)

&gt;&gt; Cast &amp; Crew Filmographies (text only)

&gt;&gt; A French Language Track (in 2

0 Dolby Surround)

&gt;&gt; English Subtitles

VIDEO -- The movie is presented on Disc #1 (which is dual-sided with no disc art)

with Side A being the Widescreen (2

35:1 aspect ratio) version and Side B being a Full-Screen (1

33:1) Pan-and-Scan version

Now why anybody on the planet would prefer the Full-Screen (aka: &quot;butchered all to hell&quot;) variant is beyond my comprehension

(Especially a super-wide 2

35:1 ratio film like this one

where

in the 1

33:1 version you're missing about 45% of the screen image at all times

) But

to each his own

IMO

however

the Widescreen is the ONLY way to go here (or with any other movie

for that matter)

The Widescreen transfer here looks A-1

Very clear

no &quot;jaggies&quot; in the background that I could see

with great color

AUDIO -- The box shows a &quot;4

0 Surround&quot; English audio track

But my Player reads the sound as &quot;3

1 Dolby Digital&quot;

Kind of strange

I thought

But

regardless of the individual number of discrete channels here

it sounds great

The previous DVD version of this movie was done in 2

0 Dolby Surround; and this SE is at least up to par with that older disc

IMO

MENUS -- A really well-done &quot;baseball-themed&quot; Menu design here

The &quot;Scene Selection&quot; screens are designed so that each scene choice looks like a baseball card

complete with an &quot;AAGPBL&quot; (&quot;All-American Girls Professional Baseball League&quot;) logo in the corner

Also shown on each of the Chapter screens is a simulated &quot;baseball card&quot; featuring one of the &quot;players&quot; (or manager) that appears in the movie

The Main Menu for disc #2

which holds all the bonus material

is cleverly laid out to represent a page of a newspaper

with the menu choices integrated into the &quot;headlines&quot; of the paper

Very cool

As is the disc art for the second disc

which is made up to look like a baseball

This flick beckons to be viewed a minimum of once per year

And perhaps even more frequently thanks to this fine two-disc SE that is now available

It's a movie that is just plain fun to sit through

And that's not likely to change

even many years down the road

&quot;A League Of Their Own&quot; will remain in a class all its own for a long

long time to come
