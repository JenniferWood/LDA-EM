Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished

the heart and soul of the story remain intact

and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch

33:18 through Ch

46:30

Much of the acting is marvelous

especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar

whose part has thankfully been enlarged

because he is riveting in every scene he is in

Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob

who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son

Joseph

Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;) is good in the lead

and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife

the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah

and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers

notably Michael Attwell (Judah)

and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon)

Included in this film

and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah

and the horrific tale his sister Dinah

both done effectively

The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting

they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama

Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah

and has the ultimate babe for a wife

the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci

The entire film though

is always mentally and visually entertaining

and has much spiritual content

As with so much of the Old Testament

there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament

and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism

Filmed in Quarzazate

Morocco

with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes

the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television

and a film about a man who &quot;does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death&quot; is worth watching again and again
