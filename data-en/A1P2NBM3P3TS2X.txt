Laserdisc collectors already have the definitive version of this movie courtesy of the Criterion Disc

Most but not all of those bonus goodies are included here

The &quot;new&quot; documentary/interview footage is actually a punched-up version of an old one released years ago on Laserdisc

I still have the Criterion Laserdisc version

and that will be the one I go to when the time rolls around to watch this movie again

Spielberg did the same thing when he released &quot;Jaws&quot; on DVD in July of 2000

What should have been a definitive release was instead an abbreviated version (I'm referring to bonus stuff

here) of the edition released as a Collector's set on Laserdisc years before

What gives

Steve
