A little too sentimental for its own good

\"A League of Their Own\" comes up just shy of a homerun

The bittersweet comedy is the true story of 1943's all-woman baseball league

put together to satisfy baseball fans while the male players went to war

Geena Davis

Lori Petty and Madonna star as the women determined to prove their mettle and disprove the popular belief that &quot;girls&quot; can't play the game

Tom Hanks co-stars as their lovable

perpetually drunk coach

and Jon Lovitz appears in a scene-stealing cameo

The film more or less follows the pattern of most sports films

setting up the conflict that will eventually pit sister against sister in the climactic championship game

It's testament to director Penny Marshall that the film mostly manages to rise above the clich&eacute;d storyline

at least until the awkward epilogue

which forces emotion instead of letting it unfold

and reduces its characters to caricatures

A League of Their Own isn't quite in a league of its own

but it's pretty close
