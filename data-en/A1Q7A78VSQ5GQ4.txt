Perhaps one of Morgan Freeman's earliest

He is a School Principal trying to take the school back from the Dopers & Pushers & Troublemakers so that the average kid can have a chance

Perhaps Joe Clark's methods are a little unorthodox (but desperate times call for desperate measures)He spoke louder and faster in this film

but the essence is there

Interesting to see how Morgan Freeman has evolved into one of the all time greats

This a true story of a Patterson NJ High School

Glad I saw it

Worth seeing-good characterizations

enjoyable
