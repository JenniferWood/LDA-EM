In Australia

this movie is titled &quot;Hills Angels&quot;

and I think that is a much better title and certainly describes the very funny female characters in this film

When confronted by a seemingly unsolvable gambling problem that is running amok in his town

instead of acting like a politician or a sociologist by blaming this

that

and the other for it

a minister

with the help of some spunky parishioners

resolves to DO something about it other than lament over it

and in the process provides viewers with some great entertainment and good clean fun that has become extinct in the graphically violent action movies of today

If I had children

I would not have any problem with them watching this movie and as a matter of fact

I saw it for the first time when I was 4 (I'm now 25)
