I can't judge this movie fairly

I have read the book and watched the musical

both live and on DVD

So

naturally

I will be making subconscious comparisons

even though we all know that movies generally undertake their own artistic direction

For one

although some people have claimed the storyline to be jumpy

I thought it was rather smooth-flowing

possibly because I already know the story beforehand

Although changes were made to the original story

for example

Valjean admitting to Cosette that he is a convict when he only did so before he died in the end

and Cosette remembering that Valjean is not her father when it was originally intended for her to believe that he was her real father

these changes were probably made to accommodate the short play time (2 hours is barely enough to fit in a 1484-pages story)

Liam Neeson portrayed Valjean to be exactly the way Hugo would have intended Valjean to be

In the beginning

he was a hard

animalistic beast of a man

But Neeson is able to morph into the gentle Mayor with ease

and that highlights Valjean's transformation

Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Javert

Never was there anyone more suited to play the cold

sadistic inspector

Uma Thurman is surprisingly convincing as Fantine

I had begun to stereotype her as the sort of action-thriller-sci-fi flick girl but this proved me wrong

Watch this movie for these three actors alone

for they bring class to your living room

What I didn't like about the movie was the lack of development on the revolution

Hugo was a revolutionary

He wanted Les Mis to ignite the people's spirits

The revolution was a crucial scene

and the death of the revolutionaries a touching one

Through this movie

I can barely recognize which ones are Enjolras

Courfeyrac

Feuilly etc and yet the character names appear on the credit roll in the end

The change of the ending (with Valjean walking free) did not leave much of an impact on me compared with the original ending

I loved the last page of Hugo's novel

where Cosette read Valjean's letter

Valjean had a tragic life

He was one of the Les Miserables

the underdogs

the wretched

For me

they had distorted the true message of Les Mis by changing the ending of the wonderful classic
