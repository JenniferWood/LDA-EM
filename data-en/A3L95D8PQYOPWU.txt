Because this is one show I watched in the 90s and never forgot

I was grateful to find it on DVD now

And there is a bonus of episodes from a follow-up series to the original

something I missed when it was aired

Michael Kitchen is a riot

sublime in his comedic delivery

The romantic leads are wildly hot

All the supporting actors are perfectly cast

There is one actor whose accent is so thick

I barely understand what he says; however

his acting is so clear

I totally get what is going on in his scenes

There's a brief scene with a dog







You don't want to miss any of this program
