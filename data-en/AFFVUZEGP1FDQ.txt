A great movie

a classic

I enjoyed this movie thoroughly

The cast is suberb and the performances they give and excellent

There is truly nothing bad about this movie

It is both inspiring and entertaining

One should truly appreciate the topic and the actors in this movie

Madonna probably gives the best performances she ever has given (and maybe could give)

Geena Davis

Tom Hanks and everyone else does a good job at making the movie believable and engaging

I highly reccomend it
