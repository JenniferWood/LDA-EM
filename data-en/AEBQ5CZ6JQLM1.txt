I had read Victor Hugo's book a long time ago

It's a novel of redemption and revolution

The movie stars Liam Neeson as Jean Valjean

a heartless convict who is transformed by a single act of mercy

Uma Thurman is Fantine

the vulnerable prostitute who begs Valjean to raise her only child Cosette played bt Claire Danes

Geoffrey Rush is the ambitious policeman determined to return Valjean to prison
