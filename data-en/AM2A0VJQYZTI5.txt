Godzilla and Mothra return for the 90's in a film that has far more potential than it actually delivers

Don't get me wrong

the special effects are great

with the final fight in Yokohama rivaling that of Godzilla vs

Mechagodzilla II

The monsters look extremely cool

Godzilla looks better than ever and Mothra looks way better than in the 60's

It's just the insanely bad script and the annoying Cosmos faries that dampen the effect of the monster madness
