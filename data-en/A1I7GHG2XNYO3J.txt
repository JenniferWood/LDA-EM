This one is pretty good

The thing about Godzilla movies

everyone knows they are cheesy (even the producers) and know one cares

Mothra is pretty cool(my personal favorite Godzilla nemesis) and ya' gotta love the fairy twins singing to the egg

Keep in mind the rating is done compared to other Godzilla movies

after all Godzilla is in a realm of his own
