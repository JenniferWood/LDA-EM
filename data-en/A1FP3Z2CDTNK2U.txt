This is an awesome movie because it was the best way to portray a really entertaining sport that unfortunately people are not going to support monitarilly today

It had brash performances by Rosie O'Donnell that was my favorite thing she ever did

Madonna can really dance

Gina Davis' and Tom Hanks were at their best too'
