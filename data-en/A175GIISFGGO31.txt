Paul Newman once said 'Give an actor a good script and he'll move the world'

Well thats what Morgan Freeman did

His portrayl of principal Joe Clark is astonishing

He obviously studied Clark very very closely







its a commmand performance

So if you want to see Freeman in one of his best movies

well this is it

A must see
