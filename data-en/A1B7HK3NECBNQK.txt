An excellent

EXCELLENT movie

Having not yet seen \"Omega Code\" and after having been profoundly disappointed (and

yes

BAD bored) with the recent \"Left Behind

\" I had a sort of \"HO-hum\" attitude when I saw this advertised at the local marquee

Regardless

at my wife's behest

we saw it last Saturday night

and it - literally - was a religious experience

I'm no Biblical scholor

but \"Megiddo\" seemed to be quite Scripturally correct

drawing almost directly from the Books of Daniel and Revelations

And I was very satisfied with the movie's resolution

One minor quibbling point

though: at the beginning of the movie

when it is trying to establish Stone Alexander's character

the writers seem to have borrowed greatly from the first two installments of the \"Omen\" series of some 25 years ago: Stone's the son of a political figure

he has an evil \"supernatural guardian

\" and he first starts showing his





\"true disposition\" while at a military school

Even Michael Beihn

the protagonist

the \"good guy\" of \"Megiddo

\" favors Sam Neill

who portrayed Michael York's character

the Antichrist

in \"Omen

\" However

York's portrayal of this dispicable character is more realistic

a tad less smarmy

less \"Hollywood\" than was the \"Omen's\" Damien Thorn

It's a great movie

but is is too intense for younger children

Oh

one very moot final point

when seen concurrently with \"Omega Code

\" the producers present the events of these movies within a \"pre-millenium\" context
