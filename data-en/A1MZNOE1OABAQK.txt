You wouldn't be too wrong choosing \"A League of Their Own\" if looking for a baseball comedy

Actually

it's more of a \"dramadey

\" like a mixture of \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" and \"Pride of the Yankees

\" only with girls

girls

girls

WWII is in progress

all the boys are fighting

so a candy bar tycoon (Jon Lovitz

\"The Benchwarmers\" and

uh

\"Happiness\") decides to start a girls' league

He sends out some scouts who find Geena Davis

Lori Petty

Madonna

Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Cavenagh who all try out for the Rockford Peaches

owned by Walter Harvey (Gary Marshall

\"Pretty Woman

\" the director's father)

Tom Hanks plays the team's coach

former baseball great

Jimmy Dugan

sort of an alcoholic George Bailey

The film is entertaining -- it features the standard rivalries between teammates

and has some well-made game montages

leading up to the World Series showdown

It's a little too sentimental at times

but for the most part \"A League of Their Own\" is fun
