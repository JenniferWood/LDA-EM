Godzilla vs

Mothra (aka) Godzilla vs

The Thing is unquestionablyThe best Godzilla movie ever made

This one has it all

Good characters

Paganistic savages worshiping idols on a remote island

the twins fairies

army tanks and army men being squashed like bugs

plus lots and lots of explosions

Any serious Godzilla fan would argue that if they were stranded on a desert island and could only have one Godzilla movie- This would be it

The story is fast paced

the characters are interesting and you actually feel remorse for Mothra when Godzilla defeats her

(Thats not the end of the movie-trust me there is more to come)Unfortunately this release is not letterboxed and has no extras

but for the low price it deserves a place in any monster movie fans library

Put the wife and kids to bed early on a Friday Night

order yourself a totally cheesy pizza and grab a cold one so you can totally kick back and enjoy this nostalgic masterpiece from a simpler time

Enjoy and let Godzilla rule
