I loved this story about Joseph

It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament

I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting

The direction was very good

the costumes inhanced the film

and acting was top notch

I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film

If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way

It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't
