This warm and delightful charmer might just be the best classic film you've probably never seen

Richard Wallace helmed this hilarious film based on the story \"The Gay Banditti\" by I

A

R

Wylie about a \"family\" of shallow scoundrels who find that pretending to be decent isn't really all that difficult

A sharp and funny screenplay by Paul Osborne and a playful score from Franz Waxman make this one of David O

Selznick's best productions

A 1930's cast that dreams are made of includes Douglas Fairbanks Jr



Janet Gaynor

Paulette Goddard

Richard Carlson

Roland Young

Billie Burke

Henry Stephenson

and Minnie Dupree as Miss Fortune

Our group of rascals are on the French Riviera about to get rich when they are politely asked to get out of town by the police

Rick (Douglass Fairbanks Jr

) was about to marry rich and put the family in the black for life

His \"sister\" George-Anne (Janet Gaynor) had just discovered too late that her mark

Duncan Macrae (Richard Carlson)

wasn't wealthy at all

He did give her a ring that has been held in his family for years

but she can't understand why thinking about him makes her cry

Rick is wide-eyed at her musings about people who actually marry for love

and in an hilarious moment in which she is trying to understand her melancholy

she tells Rick: \"How can I be in love with him

He hasn't any money

\"Roland Young is the father

Sahib

who poses as a former Bengal Lancer

and Billie Burke is the mother

\"Marmy

\" She can barely keep up with her husband's yarns of India

and at one point in the film tells a group that Rick and George-Anne were born there but she's never been

but would like to go one day

Given train tickets to London just to get them off the Riviera

George-Anne is shocked to discover that Duncan

despite having been made aware of what they were doing

has followed her

He thinks she's not like the rest of her family and can be \"cured\" and she tries to convince him for the rest of the film that she's just as worthless as they are

Trying to lose him

George-Anne meets a kind

sweethearted but lonely old lady named

appropriately enough

Miss Fortune

She is looking for a family to love and when they discover she is wealthy

they warm up to her in a big hurry

George-Anne and Rick save her life when the train wrecks and soon they are all staying in her huge home

\"working\" her until she changes her will and they are set for life

George-Anne has gone a bit soft though

and as the others take--gulp--jobs

so they can pretend to be normal people

they slowly discover that they really want to be what the kind Miss Fortune (Minnie Dupree) thinks they are

Duncan

still trying to win over George-Anne

gets Sahib a job selling cars

He tries to refuse it in a very funny scene but George-Anne forces him to accept the offer

Since it's pretty much the same thing as a con

he is so successful at it he becomes the head of the London branch

The very fast car he sells is called The Flying Wombat

Rick

meanwhile

discovers the pretty Leslie Saunders (Paulette Goddard) and charms her into giving him a job as a mail sorter

She begins to wear on him and he starts reading about engineering

When he is honest with her about what he and his family are doing

she is disturbed by his seeming lack of regret for how they are using Miss Fortune

Leslie isn't quite sure it's all an act

however

and she may be right

Miss Fortune has grown on all of them and Rick begins to wonder if they've actually become decent people and are no longer just pretending

When Miss Fortune has a serious spell and it is discovered she may not have her wealth anymore

the truth might just come out

Fairbanks and Gaynor are wonderful here

and would stand out even more were it not for the equally endearing performances from the rest of the cast

This is a fabulous classic with a very special mood

It is sweet

hilarious

sentimental

and full to the brim with charm

I can't recommend this film any higher or I would

This is not a rental

This is a sparkling diamond every film buff must own

so it will be close at hand to watch over and over
