Emily Hope (Alicia Silverstone) is a ritch bi%h desperate to get her father's attention

Too bad dad's a shady businessman who cares more about making millions illegally than he does about his own daughter

But one day Emily comes up with a plan that she hopes will change all that

She's going to fake her own kidnapping

demand a million dollar ransom and then be reunited with her father on live TV

Dad's image needs a makeover since he's under investigation by the SEC

Trouble is

on the way to her fake kidnapping

Emily gets kidnapped for real by a car thief named Vincent (Benicio Del Toro)

Now Vincent doesn't know he's kidnapped her and it's not till after he gets the car to his shop that he makes the startling discovery

She thinks he's one of her father's goons

He thinks she's crazy

The two spar verbally and physically until Vincent's partner (Harry Connick

Jr

) shows up to try and calm the situation down

Turns out him and Vincent owe a mobster named Dokus some serious cash that they don't have

so they figure they'll use Emily as a bargaining chip to try and squeeze some more money out of her old man

Problem is he could care less

He doesn't believe for a second his daughter has been kidnapped and just figures she's trying to get more money out of him

Thankfully her uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) swoops in to try and get her back

And so begins a quasi-Into The Night movie as Vincent and Emily make their way to Vincent's cabin to try to figure out what to do while being pursued by both Ray and a couple of dim-witted mobsters (Nicholas Turturro

Michael Bowen)

Inevitably Vincent and Emily fall for each other and inevitably their love is tested when Ray eventually catches up to them

Nothing in the film is very original or all that exciting for that matter

but it still has a strange charm all its own

While not everything works - the pace often lags and the plot is still a mess even with the Aaron Sorkin re-writes - enough stuff does to make this movie enjoyable

Silverstone is great to look at but painful to listen to

Del Toro really channels his idol Brando delivering a mumbling

brooding - and I guess to the ladies - irresistible performance

Connick

Jr

is very smooth and funny in his supporting role

And then

of course

there's Walken

He delivers one of his trademark oddball performances

His uncle Ray is slightly goofy yet slightly scary as well

You don't get more twisted and eccentric than his scenes with not only Del Toro

but with Sally Kirkland as well

It's no surprise that Walken has most of the film's best lines

The direction by Marco Brambilla - he of 'Demolition Man' - is slick making everything look cool and stylish

'Excess Baggage' is a movie that defines the term \"sleeper hit\"

It will either put you to sleep with its slow pace and confusing plot twists or it will make a fan out of you thanks to its quirky charms

Either way it's worth trying out
