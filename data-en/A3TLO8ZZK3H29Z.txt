Yes

the collection of 3 versions of Close Encounters is great

Yes

the picture and sound is awesome

And yes

I am still glad that I bought it

but What is up with the Cheap Packaging

Cardboard Sleeve

We spend more money on Blu-ray and HD DVDs because we know we are receiving a higher quality product

and that should be including the cases

With hundreds of titles purchased

and uniformally placed on my shelf

this disc sticks out like a sore thumb

Let's hope Sony doesn't make this mistake again

I will pay more attention to the packaging details in my future purchases
