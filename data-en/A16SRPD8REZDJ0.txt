I've already reviewed this movie

so I'm not going to repeat all the wonderfully complimentary things I said verbatim

However

the addition of this Wide-Screen edition of the film is fantastic

since the original movie was shot in Toho-Scope and the letterboxed format really shows off Eiji Tsubaraya's SFX





their scope is positively epic at times

DO THE WIDESCREEN





it's worth it
