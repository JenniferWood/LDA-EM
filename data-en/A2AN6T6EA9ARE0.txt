Godzilla Vs Mothra (1964)(Sony 2002) 2/5This is my first time seeing this film in the godzilla series but this review is about the dvd not the film

The picture is quite clear without much damage

the colour is okay to

pretty much it is an okay print not bad but not great

It is not in it's original widescreen format either

It shows signs of compression but not to the point of pixelisation

The frame rate is 24 fields 24 frames this improves on the King of the Monsters dvd as that was done in a standard NTSC VHS format of 60 fields 30 frames with a frame doubled every 4 which isn't as nice a picture

This has the same 'extras' as King of the Monsters which are the advert for the tie-in GameCube game and another 5

1 remix which makes everything sound like it's in a bathroom

Good Points: It has a little fun animated menu

it also has quite a few chapters at good points

Bad Points:It hasn't been remastered or restored

it's not in widescreen

the 5

1 sucks and not even a trailer as an extra



The rating above is for this DVD not the film

I rated it 2 stars because it is watchable as a bog standard version of the movie but more dedicated fans should save their money for a future release
