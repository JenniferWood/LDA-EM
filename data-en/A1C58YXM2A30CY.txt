A League of Their Own was a great baseball film

dedicated to the actual professional womens' baseball league that was established in 1943 and disbanded in 1954

Director Penny Marshall

who's directed her fair share of romantic comedies could have easily made this a maudlin piece

a \"chick flick\" of epic proportions but thank goodness she didn't

The story has a bit of a plot between all the baseball plays

but if you like baseball

then you will like this film and its all-star cast

The story is really about two sisters: Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty)

Kit is very jealous of her sister

feels she can't measure up and blames Dottie for whenever she fails -- and baseball is not exception

As the girls begin to bond and go through their adventures the themes of male chauvinism is pretty strong

So too are the themes of sisterhood and homage to a game that has traditionally shut out women: \"Girls can't play baseball

\"Madonna plays the sexy Mae: \"It's my name

and it's my attitude

\" Cute

Rosie O'Donnell running bases makes it hard to believe that she would later be a rather rotund talk show host

Tom Hanks as the has-been drunk coach of the team who at first thinks all he has to do is tip his hat

drink till he stinks and pee in the girls' bathroom

He later snaps to and puts together quite the team

The film also made me more aware of American baseball history -- a chapter I was not aware of

There was a hint of the future -- African Americans in baseball

another disenfranchised group at the time

Recommended

even with the somewhat saccharine sweet ending
