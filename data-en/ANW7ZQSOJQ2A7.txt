Dear D

Ullery: I would like to add a fifth film to your favorites





And since you like Dan Aykroyd so much I trust you'll appreciate the suggestion of adding \"Doctor Detroit\" to make it a Fab Five

Being a big fan of the ORIGINAL first years of SNL Comedy (when it was actually funny

) my friends and I were drawn to Doctor Detroit when it first escaped into the world

Of course

if you are also a Johhny Fever fan (WKRP in Cincinnati) you no doubt had to love Howard Hesseman as well

and fortunately he is in the film as well





Along with 3 lovely \"Women of the Evening\" -- Fran Dresher

Donna Dixon and Lydia Lei -- (pun intended

)

mostly unknown at that time

Once again we see Dan playing a very straight man (college professor) forced into a position of being charged as the one needed to save the college from takeover by using subterfuge to obtain a grant

The best advice I have is SEE IT -- RENT IT -- or just plunk down $7 -to- $9 to buy it -- You'll like it

(It is rated \"R\" for strong language





)
