This film is a worthy follow-up to both Mothra and King Kong Vs Godzilla

The film really centers on Mothra and The Shobujin's attempts to peacefully regain a giant egg that washed ashore in Japan

But human drama intervenes in the form of two greedy con-men who &#34;buy&#34; the egg for profiteering

two journalists and a scientist who are powerless to wrest the egg from them before calamity strikes

And as the tension mounts

who should appear but Godzilla himself

Fresh from his drubbing at the hands of Kong

he wastes no time devastating the country

The only hope Japan has is Mothra--who has no reason to help at all

There's human vs human drama as well as another Kaijumania showdown between Godzilla and THREE monsters

Godzilla is the bad guy here

and you wind up rooting for Mothra as the battle progresses to its destructive conclusion
