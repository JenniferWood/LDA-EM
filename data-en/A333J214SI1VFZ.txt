When you see the words 'based on a true story'

that can mean a lot or a little

I assume this movie adaptation of a true story was only very loosely based on the real life shenanigans at that high school

Morgan Freeman certainly seemed to act like no other teacher I've ever seen

met or been at the wrong end of

He spends his whole time in the movie shrieking

finger-pointing and generally being a thoroughly disagreeable man

Put simply

this behaviour would not have been tolerated (I mean who expels 300 people with only one complaint

or fires a teacher for some petty misdemeanour)

Freeman must have been short of cash around the late 1980's in order for him to do this
