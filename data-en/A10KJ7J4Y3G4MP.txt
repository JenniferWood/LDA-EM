Won't try to compete with other folks saying good things about this wonderful film

but wanted to confirm that the DVD received from Amazon

com in January 2004 is a superb transfer with full screen on one side and gorgeous Anamorphic 16:9 widescreen on the other

Watching films on a widescreen television is the coolest

Be aware it's necessary to tell your DVD player (in the set-up menu) to format for a 16:9 screen

This automatically outputs any anamorphic DVD as full-screen (without black bars top and bottom)

This will look tall &amp; skinny on an old-fashioned 4:3 monitor

but when stretched to fill a wide 16:9 screen it looks glorious
