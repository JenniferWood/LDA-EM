This is a good movie

with a happy ending and a bit of a twist that no matter what precautions one takes

some things are just destined to happen

It was hard to take Kathleen Turner as an 18 year-old; she looked more like a 40 year-old who worked hard to take care of her figure

Nevertheless

the movie was enjoyable
