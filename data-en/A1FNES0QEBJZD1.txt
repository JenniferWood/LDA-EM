This review is based upon the single disc

Blu Ray of Close Encounters of the Third Kind

Others have so fully summarized the movie and provided their opinions upon the acting performances

et al

I will refrain from doing so and just focus upon the quality of the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray which is what I do with all my reviews

With this disc you get 3 different versions of the film

you get the theatrical release

a special version and the Directors cut

I chose the Director's Cut as if it is what Spielberg envisioned and not the studios

then that I what I want to see

The theatrical version clocks in at 135 minutes

while the Special Edition clocks in at 132 minutes and the Director's Cut at 137minutes

The Audio for all 3 versions is DTS MA 5

1 lossless audio for English and French

while the Spanish viewer gets lossless Dolby True HD 5

1

Since both lossless codecs are very good and significantly better than any lossy audio codec

I do not believe that anyone could tell the difference

but more on the audio later on

VIIDEO







The cover of the Blu Ray says that the film has been remastered and I believe it

While I had not seen the film in many years and do not own the Standard Def DVD and

thus

have nothing to compare it with

all I can say is that the video transfer looks beautiful in all ways

The colors are just gorgeous with the daylight sky shots a rich and smooth blue

The blacks are as true to black as I have seen in the past with great details easily showing in these dark and shadowy areas

At no point in watching the Director's Cut did I see any artifacting nor stair-stepping which would have been prominent is many of the wide angle landscape shots

The video transfer absolutely deserves the 5 stars I gave it

AUDIO





Watched in the lossless DTS MA HD 5

1 and the balance of audio levels between the dialogue and John Williams music score was exceptionally good

The music score is spread quite nicely across the front stage with stereo imaging of the instruments nicely placed

During the first half of the movie I was a touch disappointed that the rear channels were not used that often for front to rear pans or foley FX

However

the second half of the film wakes things up with several uses for the rear channels and discreet channeling of the audio fx to both left and right

It is here where your LFE sub channel will come alive and if you have a good sub and it is set properly

it will certainly get a musical workout

I rate
