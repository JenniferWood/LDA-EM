Legendary Hong Kong action director Ringo Lam tries his shot with Van Damme and does an outstanding job

Van Damme

as a French cop

finds he has a twin brother he never knew about

Problem is

he finds out after his twin is already dead

He needs to dig deeper into his bro's cause of death and when he does he finds his brother was in deep with both the Russian mob and the FBI

He has dirt on both of them

hence his untimely death

Now he needs to get himself

along with his late brother's girlfriend (played by Natasha Henstridge)

out of the deep doo-doo his brother was in

This movie starts out at full throttle and rarely lets up

In true Ringo Lam style you are treated to some of the best directed and choreographed fight scenes

chase scenes and shoot-em-up scenes ever

One way cool fight scene near the beginning of the film takes place inside a burning room

I'm still trying to figure out how they pulled that off

Unfortunately there were also some bad decisions made

For instance: One of the FBI agents is such a grossly overweight buffoon you know there was no way he ever was or ever would be in the FBI

One of the stunts in the climax is so laughable it's difficult to imagine Lam let it pass

Now

I like seeing Henstrige naked as much as the next guy

but the love scene between her and Van Damme needed to be inserted with a crow bar

It was just poorly timed and totally gratuitous

These quibbles aside

this is still on heck of a ride

For those into the action genre of films this is right up there near the top

Order some pizza

Crack open a beer and buckle up
