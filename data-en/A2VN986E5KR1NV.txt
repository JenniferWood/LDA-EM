Without attempting to recount or even summarize the plot of CHARACTER

let me simply say that it is a stunning work of art

The acting is arresting and utterly convincing

Each character represents heartbreak and tragedy

Even the cold

hard father

Dreverhaven (brilliantly played by Jan Declier) is revealed to have a human side





albeit a terribly flawed and scarred humanity

There is tremendous pathos in the final scenes between Dreverhaven and his son

Katadreuffe (the amazing Fedja van Huet)

Even as Katadreuffe explodes in violence and rage

the sorrow and sense of loss is powerfully palpable

Van Diem's direction is flawless

He allows the actors to say so much without using many words

The slow

steady pace allows the plot to simmer before reaching a boil

The longing between Katadreuffe and his lovely co-worker is incredibly heartrending

Katadreuffe's complex relationships with his mother and his mentor are also quite striking

Van Diem gets the most out of very simple gestures





a look

a smile

a touch





perhaps the most dramatic and emotional moment in the film is when Dreverhaven extends his hand to Katadreuffe or when he later whispers

\"Help me

Jacob

\" Reviewers have invoked Kafka

Dickens

Shakespeare

and Oedipus in attempting to describe this film

All of those apply

and I don't think it's a stretch to say that this film belongs in the worthy company of those great stories

(Let me say that the father-son relationship here reminds me in a strange way of a certain famous Johnny Cash song

though I will let you guess which one

) CHARACTER is not a good \"popcorn movie

\" or even really a good \"date movie

\" But it is a great film; the emotions unleashed and the questions raised will stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled
