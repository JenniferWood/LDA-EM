My husband and I love watching hummingbirds in the summer

so when I heard about this video

I just had to buy it

It is the story of a mother hummingbird that inhabits a tiny nest in the most unlikely of places

and raises her family there

year after year

The shots are intimate and spectacular

We learned more than we had previously known about the little birds and highly recommend this to others who are as fasinated by them as we are
