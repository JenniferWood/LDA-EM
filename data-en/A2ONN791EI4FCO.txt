I remember seeing movie when I was 13

and was just floored at the special effects

and the story

Then in 1980

they came out with the \"Special Edition\"

the version where they show show the inside of the Mother Ship

and I thought

\"that was total crap

\" Never really looked for the original version

but I remember the S

E

was about the only one out on VHS

Watched the Blu-Ray Original version last night

and all I can say is WOW

Excellent picture

excellent sound

and excellent memories

If you enjoyed this movie when it first came out

then please purchase this edition

you\"ll be happy you did
