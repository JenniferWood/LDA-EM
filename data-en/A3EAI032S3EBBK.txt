This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets

I teach ancient history and civilizations

and have an earned doctorate in theology

I say this only to lend perspective to this review

This film is Biblically accurate

well-acted

and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch

Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young

this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say

Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show

and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph

Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor

nevertheless

her performance detracts little from the drama

Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers

with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon

Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom

I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power

pathos

and glory

Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's &quot;My God

my God





&quot; speech from the Egyptian prison)

the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story

When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth

the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears

As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay

one asked why no such heroes existed today

The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation

and the dearth of role models in our society

'Joseph' is both gripping in narration

and brilliant its direction

It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted

It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date

of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure

Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness

but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
