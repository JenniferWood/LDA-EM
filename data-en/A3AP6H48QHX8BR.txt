This movie is what got me into Les Mis

While

it's easy to understand why the flimmakers had the problems they had- it's hard to adapt a movie from a spotless book and one with such a immense fan following but- they did and did more than a wonderful job

Les Miserables is all about revenge

love

loss

sin

redemption

and trying to right yourself

There is a little Jean Valjean in everyone common good- trying to become better and do the right thing at all costs while also

having to be honest about your past

There is a little Fantine in everyone people that have made one mistake and are condemed for life because of it

A little Javert in everyone hell bent on revenge

Cosette- that sweet naivity and Marius- wanting to be known for something

wanting to change the world

We all can relate to the characters from Les Miserables and that was Victor Hugo's intention

While

I maybe no critic this movie moved me on a level I rarely see in the cinema

By the end credits I found myself wanting to change the world and be just an honest/decent person

While many people will complain about the historical accuracy and the literary aspects I found this movie nothing sort of touching

Liam Neeson was perfectly cast for the role of the selfless Jean Valjean and does good living up to the \"good guy\" image he set forth in \"Schindler's List

\"This movie will make Les Mis fans proud and even those who aren't Les Mis fans will be impressed

All in all don't what rent or buy this movie and see what is beyond the barricade
