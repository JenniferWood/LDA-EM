Well

there's 90 minutes of my life I can't get back

What a terrible movie

Shirley MacLaine

who is normally so adorable

plays a character that isn't even remotely likeable

Who wants to watch a character who is a thoughtless

selfish and mean spirited witch bully other people

Shame on you Shirley

you can do better than this
