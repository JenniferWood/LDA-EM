I have to say I agree with what I'm reading in most of the reviews of the compilation of this great ensemble show

I'm about as disappoitned as anyone that the original shows aren't being aired with the music that was featured back then

Being in radio myself

I understand the royalty issue that must be dealt with before the show has any chance of seeing the light of day on DVD

but so many people loved this show that it deserves far better than the generic stock music that's in any repeats that show these days unless your local TV station happened to have purchased (and hung onto) one of the older syndication packages from when the show was distributed by Victory television and features the actual songs

The \"dubbed\" version just isn't the same

and there were classic storylines throughout the entire four season run of the show

Please Fox

do us all a favor

spend the time and money and do this show right

There's an audience waiting





and finally (and somewhat off-topic): I have to disagree with the reviewer that said \"M*A*S*H\" lacked timelessness in its humor

A minor gripe in a review of another show that was a brilliant piece of ensemble work

\"WKRP\" was cancelled by CBS

the network claiming low ratings as the reason (it was #7 and had only been moved a dozen times or more)





to bring the shows to DVD (done correctly) would be the ultimate justice done to a show that had so many injustices done to it

and if it's made available

enough people will buy it

trust me
