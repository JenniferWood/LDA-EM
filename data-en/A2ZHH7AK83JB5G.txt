Sociopaths are generally believed to be totally selfish

lacking in empathy with other people and believe themselves to be above the law

Not surprisingly 75% of men in prison can be classified this way

However what if the sociopath has above average intelligence

good looks

health

opportunities and charisma

He may find a way to operate within the bounds of society and become very successful in the business or political world not caring how his behavior may effect others

Chad

the main character in the film IN THE COMPANY OF MEN seems to meet the definition of sociopath

We first meet him and nerdy co-worker Howard in an airport lounge bemoaning their bad luck in having to leave \"civilization\" (company headquarters) to spend six weeks getting a never named project started in a small unnamed city (the movie was filmed in Ft

Wayne

Indiana)

Howard who is actually higher in the company than Chad has recently been deserted by a fiance and Chad \"tells\" Howard he is also bitter over the recent sudden move out of his girlfriend

Chad who resembles a popular thirty year old fraternity boy comes up with a plan to both pass their six weeks in the boonies and get some revenge on womankind

They will both romance a \"wallflower\" type girl and then devastate her when she finds it was all an elaborate practical joke

They find Christine an attractive typist in their office who has a speech impediment because of her deafness and the cruel plan is set in motion

The movie is very well acted by the three principal actors and sadly seems realistic despite the dark plot and permeating cruelty that sometimes makes it difficult to watch

A final twist is revealed near the end of the film and the closing shot of Howard and Christine is very haunting

I've seen this movie described as a comedy but it definitely belongs in the drama section
