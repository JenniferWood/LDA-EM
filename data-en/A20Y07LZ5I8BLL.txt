as many thers have already reviewed this classic

i will make it short and sweet

lets just say that the twin girls

all 11\" of them

have mysteriously enchanting voices

mothra cares about us more than \"the man\" does

and the photographer dresses as smartly as her character is

please

for the love of larvae

watch this

who cares if it is letterboxed

or full screen





it is a gem

you will laugh

cry

and perhaps pee a little

seriously

this is one of the best worst movies EVER
