With so many true story movies out there

I'm glad to say this is a good one

Now

saying that Mr

Clark aka Morgan Freeman did a great job

Sometimes he seems heartless but in the interior of his heart

he does care

I thought there was some funny parts

some great uplifting parts

and parts that made you feel sorry for \"real schools\" that goes through \"real life drama\" of education

I love when they sang in the bathroom the school song

well

the new remix of it

It's a great movie

I like it and recommend it to everyone
