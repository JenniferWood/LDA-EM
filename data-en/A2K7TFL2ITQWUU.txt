Let me start of by saying that Les Miserables is a huge book and the thought of trying to get that whole book into a movie is impossible

In order to do such a think the script writter must make some liberties to accomplish the means

The first half of the movie is pretty good

it stays true to the story and the things that are cut are are things that are appropriate to cut out

I thought the story flowed as well as it possibly could and one could easily understand what was going on even if one had not read the book

I thought it was well acted with great performances from the actor/actress who played Javert and Fantine

Let me say some of the liberties and things they cut out of the second half did not sit well with me

First off

the Ternardiers are hardly in this movie

They are there just for Jean Val Jean to pick up Cossette

The Ternardiers play such a huge part of the book to have them almostly completely cut out of the movie

was to me

stupid

The Ternardier daugthers aren't even in the movie which is hard to stomache when Eponine plays such a big part and the sons are not directly connected to the Ternardiers at all

Marious grandfather was also left out of the film as well

The Jean Val Jean in the book would never have beaten up Javert to escape

he would never have slapped Cossette and he would never have walked happily around at the end when Javert killed himself

Jean Val Jean was so non violent that he didn't even shoot at anyone when he was in the barricade

The thing that upset me the most was Marius

Marius to me

in the film was creepy

The way he stocked Cossette in the film and was very aggressive was almost sickening

He pretty much gives her his poem and then invites her outside for a \"booty call\" or a makeout party

I didn't feel any love at all between Marius and Cossette to me it was more lust than anything

Stick with the musical or the book and skip this movie
