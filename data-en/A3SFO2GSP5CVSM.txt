It is odd how memory unfolds from art

It's been twenty or so years since I last saw the classic 1964 color Godzilla film

Mothra Vs

Godzilla (better known to American audiences by the title Godzilla Vs

The Thing

as Roger Corman's company

AIP redubbed it to lend more mystery to the ad campaign) yet

upon popping in the Toho Master Collection DVD of the film

instantly some things returned to me

of earlier viewings

The first was Godzilla's famed entrance into the film

a half hour or so in

when reporters are covering a story about a radioactive mud field

after a typhoon has hit Japan's countryside

Suddenly

the ground shakes

and it seems that an earthquake is abrewing

Except that it turns out to be Godzilla rising from beneath the mud

after having been swept ashore and buried

The second thing is

seeing it in color

on television

even though my family did not get color television until the late 1980s

I recall watching the film during a Godzilla marathon on Thanksgiving Day

in New York City

thus recalling Godzilla's emergence scene

but it had to be at the home of one of my relatives

Back in the 1970s

the local

non-network

television stations would often run monster marathons on Thanksgiving

It was usually on Channel 9 (WOR) or Channel 11 (WPIX)

and the marathons would be Godzilla films and King Kong films

such as King Kong

Son Of Kong

Mighty Joe Young

and

of course

King Kong Vs

Godzilla

The third memory goes back even further into my youth

into my early elementary school years

when I

and some neighborhood pals

watched the film at a local 24 hour movie theater that often played children's films in the morning

from reels of old films that they had extra copies of

including older Ray Harryhausen

Hammer Horror

and AIP/Roger Corman films

My pals and I would often see the films free if we did some cleaning and chores for the theater owner

To see this film in color AND on the big screen still remains ensconced in my memory as a great thrill

even if the film

itself

is not the best in the original series of films from the 1950s through 1970s (aka the Showa Era films)

This claim

though

is widely and wrongly disputed by many other critics of the Japanese monster films of the era

but

in terms of cinema quality

the only two films in the Showa series which can count as films of depth and substance are the original 1954 film Godzilla

King Of The Monsters

which was an allegory on nuclear weaponry and war

and 1969's Godzilla's Revenge

which was a sharp allegory on childhood fears and dangers

masquing as a monster film

The rest of the series

excepting Godzilla's Revenge

began a slow decline into campiness

starting with the series' second film

1955's Godzilla Raids Again

which

like the original

was shot in black and white

and featured Godzilla as a force of nature

not cute and cuddly

The third film in the series was 1962's King Kong Vs

Godzilla

which was a more childish film

yet still played out as a broad satiric farce of modern consumerism

This film

the series' fourth

while not terrible

simply lacked the camp quality that made its predecessor film

if not great cinema

great fun

Mothra Vs

Godzilla is simply a rather paint-by-numbers film

with solid acting

solid special effects

but a rather ludicrous storyline: that the giant moth

Mothra

from its own titular 1961 film

would battle a huge

radioactive

fire-breathing dinosaur

and ultimately win

It's another step down

film-wise

in the series
