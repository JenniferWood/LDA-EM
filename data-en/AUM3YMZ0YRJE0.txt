Normally I tend to avoid comedies

preferring psychological dramas or action films

So when my partner dragged me to this

I was surprised and delighted as its depth and ironies and multi-layered story

It starts off in a mid-life crisis: mom is separated and struggling

has a caring child

and wonders if her whole life has been a mistake at her 25th reunion

Suddenly

she finds herself back in time

right at the moment that she made her most important choices

When she realizes that she may actually be back in time

she injects a kind of nostalgic sarcasm into everything unlike any comedy I have ever seen

It is funny

moving

and deep

quite an amazing combination

You never know if it was just a dream

but suspect it was not

The acting is absolutely wonderful

too

This may be K Turner's best role: she is at turns beautiful

awkward

sexy

mean

caring

ironic

and loving

And it is all believable

This was also the first film I saw Nicolas Cage in

and he is an amazingly good adolescent of the late 50s

Sophia Coppola is also wonderful

I was scared I might be disappointed seeing this nearly 20 years after I first saw it

but it moved me just as deeply

This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen

worthy of a talent like Coppola's
