WE ALL KNOW DAN AYKROYD IS A GREAT COMEDY ACTOR

BUT I NEVER THOUGHT OF KIM BASINGER AS A COMEDY ACTRESS

UNTIL NOW

SHE IS OUTSTANDING

COMBINE HER

AYKROYD

AND A GOOD DIRECTOR WITH A BELIEVABLE SCRIPT (FOR AN S/F STORY)AND YOU HAVE AN EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING FILM

I WON'T SPOIL THE MOVIE BY TELLING YOU THE PLOT

TOO MANY OTHER \"REVIEWERS\" THINK THAT A REVIEW MEANS TELLING THE WHOLE STORY

SOME ADULT HUMOR

BUT IT IS CAREFULLY DONE

THERE IS NO NUDITY

OR NOTICEABLY OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE(IF I DID MISS ANY SWEAR WORDS

THEY WEREN'T SERIOUS

CERTAINLY NOTHING YOUR 6-YEAR-OLD HASN'T HEARD BEFORE)

ALL-IN-ALL

A GREAT FAMILY FILM

WELL WORTH GETTING
