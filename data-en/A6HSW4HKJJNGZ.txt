The special effects in this movie are awesome

especially considering the time it was made

they are still fantastic

I enjoyed watching this with my kids for the first time

and look forward to watching it with my grand kids when they are old enough

I'm always surprised if someone say they haven't watched

I tell them they are deprived and need to watch it soon

Yes this movie is highly recommended
