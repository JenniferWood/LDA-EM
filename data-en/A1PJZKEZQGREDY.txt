I'm sure you've heard politicians make the following claim: \"We need to reduce our deficit so that our children don't end up paying for our bad spending habits

\" While I agree wholeheartedly that the US spending is completely out of control -- I am for a forced balanced budget

with only possible exceptions being perhaps wartime scenarios -- I roll my eyes when I hear the \"children\" part

Why

Well

it devolves into an \"appeal to emotion\" argument

which actually makes it not an argument at all as it would then be invalid

All you really need to say is

\"It is economically undesirable to run a debt

\" and that is sufficient

Leave the whole \"children\" part out

And if you'll notice

not too many women or children are killed or harmed in this film

The filmmakers know that they need the \"bad guys\" here to still be mildly sympathetic

at least to an American audience

so everyone that gets hurt or killed here seems to be a man

It's OK to kill off guys in America

after all

I did watch a home invasion reenactment on ID TV one time

where the two perps killed a whole family -- including a couple of very young children -- with hammers

Yikes

So yes

women and children are not safe from real-life criminals

But there's something even worse going on here

If you watch closely

one of the only characters here that is both smart and ethical is the black guy

Everyone else is \"ethically malleable\" for a lack of better phrasing; either that

or not the sharpest knife in the drawer

Why is this

Well

most likely

the screenwriter succumbed to political correctness pressures on that front would be my guess

I was mildly interested in checking out this film due to an odd coincidence: if you know the true story about \"The Toy Box Killer\" -- David Parker Ray -- you will realize that

while this film was being shot in Truth or Consequences

NM (peeking around the web it wasn't) -- Mr

Ray was torturing women in nearly unspeakable ways in that same city

And right about the same time

1997

his sidekick Cindy Hendy

who moved out of a town in Washington State just as I was moving in

was travelling down to join him

It's ironic how life does imitate art

or vice versa

as we have some pretty bad characters in this film as well

This movie could have been actually pretty decent

but as I've been implying

it took the cowardly way out

I did like some of the acting

in particular Vincent Gallo

I tell you

he could act in the worst movie ever and still pull off a great performance

He has a real raw edge to him while still holding his acting fundamentals

And while I'm not the biggest Kiefer Sutherland
