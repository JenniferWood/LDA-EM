While it is true that there is deviations from Hugo's immortal work

I believe that up until the ending (which falls short of the mark)

the story line is true to the novel

My point is simply this: any novel converted to a movie must be edited

Any judgements to be made by those who know the source should take into account the motivations of the characters and the major details of the story

not wory if all 1463 pages were covered

I was moved by Jean Valjean's motivations to protect Cosette

to hide from Javert and project the godliness of the Bishop to all his actions

Liam Neeson is true to the character and Geoffrey Rush plays Javert par excellence

The character of Thenardier wasn't evil enough

however he was omitted from the second half of the story

where his evil and cunning are truly developed in the Novel

Cosette's character was a bit modernized and liberated too much
