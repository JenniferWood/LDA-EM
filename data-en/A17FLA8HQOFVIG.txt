Cruelty takes many forms

This film is about the emotional kind

Two young corporate men

on a six-week company assignment in a small city

plot to seduce and then dump an vulnerable deaf young woman

The idea is to hurt someone and some of this is hard to watch

especially when the more vicscious of the two makes sick jokes about her handicap

The actors are unknowns but they do an outstanding job

and the screenplay is well written

although a bit long

Some interesting concepts are raised

particularly about the one-upmanship and power plays that hurt and destroy

At the end of the movie

one of the men deeply regrets what he has done and realizes he has also be duped by his supposed friend

&quot;Why

&quot; he asks

&quot;Because I could

&quot; is the answer
