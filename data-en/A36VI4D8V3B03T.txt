When you wish upon a star

makes no difference who you are

anything your heart desires will come to you

Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is the journey of Roy Neary

Roy Neary is a dreamer

stuck in the mundane craziness of everyday life

One night Roy sees something that changes his life

he has a Close Encounter with something unexplainable

Roy's life goes into an tailspin

He loses many things that are dear to him in his search for truth

his curiosity becomes an obsession

Roy begins to see the shape of a mountain in pillows

in shaving cream

and seems to be falling apart at the seams

This Close Encounter has changed Roy Neary's life

and that of those who are featured along his journey

This film has stood the test of time for thirty years

and is a testament to the talent of Steven Spielberg

This film

along with Star Wars revolutionized not only special effects but blockbusters in general

I've never seen another film that weaves both music and special effects so beautifully

If you haven't seen this classic and timeless film

please take the time to do so

It is an experience that you will never forget

Like a bolt out of the blue

fate steps in and sees you thruWhen you wish upon a star

your dreams come true
