Almost everything is enlightening

especially on repeated viewings

in Steven Spielberg's best movie (IMHO)

And there seems not a wasted frame (even in cut/uncut/recut DVD extras) involved in this

a strange

wonderful SCI-FI/FANTASY film that blurs the lines joyfully between the two genres

On one hand

CE3K is based upon just enough facts and evidence (with credibility) about the UFO/ET phenomenom (continuing to present day) to effectively suspend disbelief in the audience

but is filled with amazing and eye candy CGI special effects to realize that vision of those crazies who have been contacted

And those who have yet not

Except for the original Apocalypse Now (not the crappy and detracting \"redux\")

this is almost a \"perfect film\" in every way

Especially for \"Hollyweird

\" Shame this had to come in the same year as the original \"Star Wars

\" As well as other great films

Roy Neary is the everyman

Just an ordinary American schlmoe in a small town

an electric power county repairman

who one unexpected night

called out on an emergency power blackout

is encountered on a dark

quiet

star-filled night sky

by something very strange

and beings far beyond his understanding

His truck is \"explored\" by a brightly lit UFO

turning his vehicle suddenly anti-gravity

and sunburning one side of his face as he tried to look up at the ET craft

in a truck whose electronic systems and radio have all gone haywire and dark

Everyman Neary (Richard Dryefuss) sees a lot of other amazingly colorful and special

special effects shortly after his first encounter

but with a non-understanding wife (Teri Garr)

his personal life falling apart because he just can't get over WHAT HE EXPERIENCED (despite official government denials) and becomes obsessed with it

Roy hooks up with Jillian (Melinda Dillon) who shared Neary's experiences

and whose young boy was apparently abducted by the ufo's and E

T

Unlike Spielberg's later (more successful financially but much less so artistically) \"ET: The Extraterrestrial

\" Close Encounters captures the awe and wonder at the confrontation of the unknown and frighteningly unexplored

While in ET

most of what is presented is childlike and revealed

in CE3K (Close Encounters of the Third Kind)

the genius of Spielberg is more fully realized and more rewardingly subtle

Maybe Steve was just uncorrupted by the Hollywood system

but while I like ET

Close Encounters is presented as a mystery in the most cosmic sense

A normal American joe encounters the extraordinary

How will he resolve this

And what wonders await

I have always had a problem with the various versions and releases/edits of this film

Even with deleted scenes and unseen ones however

there really is no \"filler\" here

This was and is

Hollywood SCI-FI/FANTASY filmmaking at its best

along with George Lucas and his efforts of course

I envy those who have never experienced this movie

I've seen it (in all its forms) more than any other film (save perhaps Apocalypse Now in its two forms)

and there are parts I still MUST watch

whenever it appears on the tube

It is a movie of mystery and frustration

of identification with the characters and that sense of wonder of exploring the unknown

and while Spielberg's \"ET\" might've been a compelling exploration of that quest to understand the wonderous unknown

this movie is even more compelling

And appeals not to the child

but to the child within all of us

so called \"adults

\"\"Even if there ain't no such thing

\" Roy Neary said

The story is believable

the characters are all of us in a way

the special effects are spectacular

the wonder of it all is evident in almost every frame

the music is second to none

and this was

and remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement
