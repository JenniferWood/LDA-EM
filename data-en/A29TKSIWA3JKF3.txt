I've always found this movie fascinating then exasperating because of all those pesky unanswered question that inevitably pop up with each viewing

Such as



























just how benign can these aliens be when they persist on kidnapping people

Yes

they eventually return them after they've ruined their lives by separating them from everyone they knew and loved (only Melinda Dillon as Jillian Guiler gets her son back in a timely fashion)

The scientists never actually converse with these obviously superior beings yet self congratulate themselves for a few obscure hand gestures and a couple of musical notes

For that

they're willing to hand over a few more live specimens for the aliens to do



























what

Spielberg states there are no villains in this movie

which automatically prompts the query

just what does Spielberg consider villainous

He depicts the military as being particularly shady without explanation; willing to trample over civil liberties without qualms

killing livestock in the bargain

using scare tactics and detention as a deterrent

For what

why the great lengths to deny all this

Worse

they gas people as they are climbing a dangerously steep rock formation

What if they gassed someone who then missteps and falls to their death

Whoops

And just how great was their security anyway considering two people just waltzed into the middle of their setup with no one noticing

Then there's the case of Richard Dreyfuss' character

Roy

The man becomes instantly obsessed and not a little manic

His wife (Teri Garr) becomes instantly unhinged and not a little shrill

She dumps him and he dumps his entire family without a thought or twinge of regret; the ultimate deadbeat dad

glorified then lauded as a visionary willing to leave everything behind for the adventure of a lifetime

All I could think while he was escorted aboard the mother ship like the catch of the day



















those are mighty skinny aliens



























To Serve Man



























it's a cookbook

Yes

this movie is incredibly pretty and terribly entertaining; with dazzling special effects and decent performances by all (especially Melinda Dillon)

But

I still have issues with the way the plot was handled

Underneath all that wonder and bedazzlement there are too many questions that are blissfully ignored

Just because the alien smiled doesn't mean it was benevolent

It could have been gas
