I became a Nicholas Cage fan after \"City of Angels\" In this movie

he shows he can be sensitive as well as funny

The pairing of Nicholas Cage and Shirley MacLaine is brilliant

The chemistry between these two actors is wonderful and belivable as the relationship between them goes from tolerance to friendship and love
