I was a kid at a great time for movies

In my pre-teen and early teen years

I was treated to the Star Wars Trilogy

the Raiders of the Lost Ark series

Star Trek - the Motion Picture

Superman - so many great movies for the young (and young at heart)

Out of all the great sci-fi and adventure films of the late '70s and early '80s

I always liked CE3K the best

The best quality of Steven Spielberg has always been his ability to provoke a sense of wonder

and nowhere is that more evident than here

We marvel along with the characters at the strange happenings of the early movie

and Dreyfuss and company convey perfectly the astonishment of the breathtaking mothership

Where Star Wars was a fairy tale

Close Encounters is an intelligent look at what might take place if &quot;we are not alone&quot;

As for the DVD edition

I'm perfectly happy with it - the goodies are nice

and let's face it

the whole &quot;inside the mothership&quot; thing was never going to match our imaginations

anyway

Hard to imagine a serious DVD collection that passed this one up
