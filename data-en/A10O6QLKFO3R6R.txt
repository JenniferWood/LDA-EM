Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur \"The Fonz\" Fonzarelli on Happy Days

I took a chance on this

He's an even better actor than I remember

The story is set during the depression

Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families

Instead of ghosts

he has visions involving the people he's left destitute

Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are

I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting

Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it

as was a young Dorian Harewood

A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection
