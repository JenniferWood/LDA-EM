I had been hearing how great this movie was but I had never seen it

So I bought the dvd

I was a little disappointed

This version has the added scenes that were not shown in the original theatrical release

and maybe that is what I don't like

It is slow and too long

If you have already seen it and liked it then this is a good dvd

but if you haven't scene it

I would rent it first

just in case
