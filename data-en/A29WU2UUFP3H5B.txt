This is an accurate and realistic depiction of Scripture

It is nice to watch a Bible story that is not a cartoon and not an overacted

way too serious presentation

Bible heroes on film are often treated as if they walked on earth with a halo constantly hovering over them

This is a story about a man who follows God's heart through thick and thin (mostly thin)

but you can relate to him because he is portrayed as an ordinary

albeit tremendously faithful

man
