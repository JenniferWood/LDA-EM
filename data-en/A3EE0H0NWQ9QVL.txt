'Lean on Me' takes another educational figure and puts him at the head of the class

Hot-tempered

but motivational

Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) takes the helm of New Jersey's East Side High School once the seat of academic excellence

Facing undaunting turmoil

the school he has but one year to shape up is full of drug dealers

fights

and general mayhem

Knowing that to get anyone to obey the rules

you have to enforce all

Clark \"takes no prisoners\" and armed with a megaphone and locks to keep criminals out

he gives his student body a whole new outlook on life

But between his scornful nemesis

Leona Barrett (Lynne Thigpen) and a desperate and unpopular mayor (Alan North)

he has more than his martinet sensibilities to keep in check

Seeing Morgan Freeman not play someone sage and mellow is a real treat

Sometimes his character makes us laugh and smile

especially when we see his soft heart behind the tough talk

With a convincing set of actors and situations

the story doesn't try to whitewash the problems or the hero's idiosyncracies

Unsurprisingly done by 'Rocky' director John Avildsen

'Lean on Me' does inspiration with class
