This was one of the best programs ever to be broadcast on either public television (which is saying a great deal given other legendary programs like I'Claudius

Poldark

and Upstairs

The story centers on the return of a brash young surgeon from London to his native Manchester to tend his alcoholic father

In connection with his return he joins the staff of a local hospital and shortly thereafter falls in love with an older woman he met on the trip from London
