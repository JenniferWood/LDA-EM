1938

Black & White-This is a charming film about a family of con artist whose lives are changed by a little old lady

I love Janet Gaynor

and she puts in a wonderful performance as usual

This is a pretty boy part for the the talented Douglas Fairbanks Jr

The part doesn't really show off his talent

but he is easy on the eyes

Richard Carlson plays a Scottish suitor for Gaynor- not really believable

The somewhat slow beginning is transformed by the appearance of Minnie Dupree as Ellen Fortune
