It's amazing the amounts of non-constructive entertainment that IFC can provide at two in the morning

In the Company of Men is one of those films that slowly drags you in

In fact

here's my dialogue with this film

if I'd have had one

Me: \"Dude

I've got to go to bed

\"In the Company of Men: \"You know you can't

You said that with Boys Don't Cry

too

and look what happened there

\"Me: \"You're right

These characters are so engrossing

I can't believe these two guys are going to intentionally set out to date this girl - a deaf girl at that - with the sole purpose of dumping her in an attempt to hurt her as harshly as they can

\"Film: \"Yep

I've got one of those storylines that simply rocks

Keep watching

it's only going to get worse for our deaf little hottie

These two guys are as bad as they come

Plus

Eckhart actually does a good acting job in this one

He's come a long way since Your Friends and Neighbors

The other films and I have not invited that movie to a party in a long time

There's something smelly about her when she comes over

I think its vomit

\"Me: (two hours later) \"You were right

Mr

Film

The ending is really quite amazing

especially the part where the second guy ends up going borderline nuts and







\"Film: \"shhhhhh

don't spoil it

Now go write a review on Amazon

\"Me: \"Yes

Master





\"
