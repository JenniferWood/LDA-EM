In real life

Lee Marvin is a Marine that received a purple heart after being shot in the buttox during the battle for Saipan

Now here he is afterwards making movies where he is confronting his adversary and being the representative for the American side of the WWII GI psyche

His opposite is a Japanese soldier who equally does a splendid job to bring one up to speed with his culture

Both different and somehow the same

United together by a common goal of survival

yet on a hair trigger to let their warrior spirit flare

Interesting concept for a movie

Well done

appropriately cast
