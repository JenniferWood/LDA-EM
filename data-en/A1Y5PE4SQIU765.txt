I bought this VHS movie because it brought back such fond memories of the light-hearted comedic movies of the 70s with Cloris Leachman

Karen Vaentine

& many other actors in this farce about city corruption

The finale is something very funny to watch

even now

30 years later

It is very interesting to see parts of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley used to film this movie that still are the same if you drive thru the neighborhoods

Even if you or your children have not seen this movie before

it will make for a fun & wholesome evening for the entire family
