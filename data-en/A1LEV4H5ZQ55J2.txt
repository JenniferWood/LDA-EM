This film is set in revolutionary France

focusing more on the \"miserable\" times

rather than the revolution

Liam Neeson plays Jean Valjean

an ex-convict sentenced to 19 years hard labor for stealing bread

Hardened by the experience he jumps parole and steals silverware from a priest

But instead of pointing the finger of guilt

the priest lets him keep the loot and gives him even more

This act of forgiveness forever changes Jean Valjean

Among his many benevolent acts

Jean befriends a prostitute (played by Uma Thurman) and promises to raise her little girl-child (full-grown played by Claire Danes)

Geoffrey Rush plays the antagonistic and ambitious policeman

determined to return Valjean to prison

The film is set amidst the confusion and political upheaval of the French revolution

From start to finish

this epic film portrays human drama and very worth watching
