I love this Godzilla movie

It is the one where there are two tiny Japanese twins trying to save an island

If you are a fan of old Sci-Fi movies

you must have this one in your video library

I also bought a copy for my 20-something son

who is an anime fan and who loves Sci-Fi

He grew up watching the old Godzilla movies with me

and I think it enhanced his imagination

This is actually a movie the whole family will enjoy--it has the English dubbed in

so it is easy to follow the story line
