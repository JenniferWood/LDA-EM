\"True story of New Jersey high school principal Joe Clark

wins support and respect of students for his controversial methods in ridding the school of violent students and drug dealers

\"Of course Morgan Freeman was excellent

Even though the movie was made over 20 years ago the problems still exist today in many places

Especially in the \"Education Establishment\" itself

a seemingly self perpetuating political animal

Joe Clark and Marva Collins helped many young students and could have helped our public schools

But

alas

help has not been wanted in most cases





not all





but most

It's a good movie
