This is what might be called a \"light romance\" and not a screwball comedy at all

It's about a family of con artists that goes straight after encountering a generous old lady

The casting is poor

(It was nearly Gaynor's last film

for obvious reasons

Richard Carlson is wasted entirely

and Fairbanks is wholly unconvincing

) There are no laughs

Some of the sets are incredibly phony

And in the end the director had to rely on a parade of pups to generate good feelings

In short

this is a time waster

alarmingly out of step with the great comedies being made at the time

It's hard to believe that Selznik could be so clueless
