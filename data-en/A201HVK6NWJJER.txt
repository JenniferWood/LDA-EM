This is the best DVD edition that has been released of this film

It has 3 different versions of this movie: Theatrical

Special and Director's Cut

The problem is that there are some altered and edited scenes

that are only shown in their entirety in the Theatrical version

But

the sound and visual quality is perfect on all of them and there's some good bonus features

So

this is totally worth the price

If you haven't seen this movie

see it
