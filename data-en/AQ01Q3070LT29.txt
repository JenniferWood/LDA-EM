This version does not include the \"Special Edition\" ending made in 1980 for the re-issue of the film

However

the \"Special Edition\" new ending is seen in Deleted Scenes on Disc 2

The best science-fiction film ever made

Every child and adult should see it

Definatly a movie that should be seen in the theater

Perhaps it should be re-released again

This film has an all-star cast: Richard Dreyfuss

Teri Garr

Melinda Dillon

Bob Balaban

Francois Truffaut and George Di Cenzo

The film is perfectly cast with Richard Dreyfuss

Teri Garr

Melinda Dillon and the young kids

They have three children (Shawn Bishop

Adrienne Campbell

He is also a sensitive man

One night he drives to a rural area and stops at a railroad crossing

This moment is about to change the rest of his life

He continues to have visions of something

but he does not know what it is yet

There is a mother

Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) who raises her young son

Barry (Cary Guffey) in Muncie

Indiana

There is some kind of storm brewing over

The toys suddenly come on

the vaccuum is running around

the kitchen is a mess

Later

after her son is taken by a bright light

she too has these visions of something

Some people have the same vision and it leads them to one specific place in the United States

Disc Two includes a 1 hour and 41 minute documentary

\"The Making Of Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"

Very interesting details about filming locations

casting

a deleted scene

and seven new scenes added into the 1980 re-issue called \"Special Edition: Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"

Also on Disc Two

an over 4-minute theatrical trailer of the original film and a theatrical trailer for the \"Special Edition\" version

An over 5-minute 1977 featureete of the original film

Over 15 unseen deleted scenes not seen in the original and not the \"Special Edition\"

except for the \"Special Edition\" ending which is shown

The original \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was released in 1977

It ran at 2 hours

15 minutes

In 1980

Steven Spielberg re-worked the film cutting some scenes out and adding newly-filmed scenes with more of Richard Dreyfuss inside the Mothership

It also included the song

\"When You Wish Upon A Star\" in end credits

For the ABC Network version in the 1980's

another version of the film was made

It included the \"Special Edition\"

but with \"all existing footage\" from the original film also added

It ran at over 2 hours and 20 minutes

In 1998

Steven Spielberg again re-edited the film for a \"Collector's Edition\"

It does not include the \"Special Edition\" ending of inside the Mothership with Richard Dreyfuss

It ran 2 hours and 17 minutes

All of us fans hope that some day soon

Steven Spielberg may release the ultimate longest version with the original footage and the \"special edition\" footage and the additional network-tv footage all together in the movie itself and release it on DVD

A full-screen version (standard) would be nice too

(In December 2007

All versions of the film was released in a new ultimate DVD package)

Subliminals: The top of the mothership made to look like an oil refinery with pipes and tubes

but subliminally to suggest scale like the New York City skyscrapers

The bottom of the ship like a huge breast

hince the name Mothership

In a tight shot as ship flies in (rock and Melinda Dillon on right)

a little upside-down R2-D2 (Star Wars [1977]) is hanging to the left of three circle lights

The shapes in the shaving cream

the mud pack

the mashed potatoes are subliminal to what you will finally see

Another film had the working title of \"Night Skies\" that could have become a sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)

But the story was re-worked and ultimatly became

E

T

- The Extra-Terrestrial (2-Disc Widescreen Limited Collector's Edition)(1982)

Richard Dreyfuss and Teri Garr worked together again in
