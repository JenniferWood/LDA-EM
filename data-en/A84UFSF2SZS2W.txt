Childhood delivered many treasures

among them the beloved Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas

which was (in my childhood) shown on HBO annually

My brother and I adored this story in which two otters (a mother and son) each sacrifice something that is not only important to but necessary to the livelihood of the other in order to give her/him something s/he truly wants for Christmas

Unfortunately

the sacrifice proves to be for nothing

but both forgive each other and also praise the value of having the courage to take a risk

It turns out that all is NOT lost for this pair

and they manage to \"win\" something possibly even better in the end than what they were hoping for

However

the problem with this particular childhood treasure is that

first of all

it stopped being shown on HBO and was not on for a number of years

Then later

it was shown on Nickelodeon ir maybe ABC

Fine and dandy in some other incarnation

When it was finally released on video and DVD

which certainly sent my sentimental adult self over the moon with glee

I was totally dismayed and horrified to find that some fine

funny and important scenes and lines were removed

In one scene

Ma Otter is conversing with Gretchen Fox

and as the haughty Fox trots off without listening to Ma Otter

Ma Otter utters under her breath

\"I'd really like it if you'd





fall off the dock

\" (Or something similar

) That line was removed completely

and immediately after this occurs

a possum fishing on the riverside laughs and says

\"That's telling her

Alice

\"





But this line from the possum does not even make sense because Alice Otter did not say anything in this butchered version of the film

I don't know WHY this was removed; maybe it was just seen as \"not nice\" in the political correctness that rules these days

but I would not say I am worse off for having seen the version with this very funny and appropriate phrase in the original

There are other changes in the film that were resoundingly disappointing; I know I am not alone in being disappointed because I have seen other reviews expressing the same letdown

People don't want their cherished memories tampered with

This film is STILL a treasure

and even though I am an adult

I still watch it every year

loving the characters and loving the songs





enjoying the rambunctious nature of the Riverbottom Nightmare Band

loving all the creative and wonderful puppets and feeling a special sort of nostalgia that is impossible to duplicate in any other way

I just wish that this film were duplicated PRECISELY as it was when it was originally released

Only then would it be perfect
