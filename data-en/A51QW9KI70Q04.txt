I remember seeing this at the theater and thought the DVD would be a good addition to my collection

My memory of the story was better than the DVD turned out to be

Too many special effects have happened since this movie first came out

and they make the ones in Close Encounters look contrived

I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would

If you find it on sale you might want to pick it up
