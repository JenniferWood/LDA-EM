I experienced this film as a young lad and am pleased to own this very good DVD reproduction

Aside from all the obvious DVD advantages

I really enjoyed the extra features on this two-disc DVD

The interviews with Spielberg and others involved in the film are pretty facinating and insightful

Of course it is the film itself that is or isn't worth owning and for the excellent performances and the interesting concepts and questions presented here

this is a film worthy of repeat viewings and a fine addition to any DVD library
