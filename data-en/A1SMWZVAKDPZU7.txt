are on blu-ray

in the 2-disc set

all are excellent

for different reasons

and all are part of cinematic history

I like Spielberg's third Director's Cut the best

except that it excludes Roy at the power station in the beginning which was shown in the 1977 original theatrical release version

This scene was important

to show why Roy chooses not to show up for that job anymore after his initial UFO sighting (the job was thankless and his bosses were real A-holes)

Flip-flopped in the Special Edition and Director's Cut are the night sighting picnic with the India \"Where did these sounds come from

\" segments

which

I think

flow better in the order they were presented in the 1977 version

The cut between the night sighting picnic that turns out to be noisy helicopters and the subsequent dead-quiet of the observation station is more jarring in the latter two versions than in the 1977 version

where the noisy helicopter's search light on Roy cuts to the cars arriving in India in sunlight

But

in the grand scheme

of the timeline of chronologically telling the story

one can see why Spielberg flip-flopped the order of these two scenes

The \"pillow mountain bit\" is happily removed from the latter two versions; never much cared for that

Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed of Rocky fame) does a brief cameo in the 1977 version as an Army seargant who interrogates suspicious-looking Roy

who looks like a potential looter

during the evacuation sequence

when the bird salesman is doing a great scare job in the background

This bit

quirky but not really necessary

is happily removed from the latter two versions

and instead the scene hangs on the bird salesman saying \"Even my dog has a gas mask

And any of you folks are worth more than a dog

\" Funny

The Roy in the bathtub fully-clothed sequence

which ends in a horrible screaming match that involves the whole Neary family

followed by the Roy yanking out the neighbor's chicken wire and throwing bricks and dirt into his kitchen window to build his ultimate Devil's Tower model next day

perfectly segues into Roy's wife

Ronnie

taking the kids and leaving for her sister's

for good

in the Director's Cut

In the 1977 cut

we don't know what the heck Ronnie is talking about when she says to Roy

in the morning

\"I'm sorry about last night\"

and

in the 1980 Special Edition cut

the entire Roy throwing dirt into the house scene is excised

cutting from Roy realizing that Devil's Tower has a cut-off peak

to Ronnie taking the kids

which also doesn't make sense

I'm glad Spielberg finally got it right by including BOTH scenes in his Director's Cut

This is one of the most AWESOME achievements in cinematic history

a triumph of human imagination

and a film that has a truly noble

altruistic agenda

in an era of otherwise formulaic \"beastie\" monster movies

It gets the awesome transfer

in all 3 versions

that it deserves

Spielberg's critics said \"lightning can't strike twice\" after the wunderkind young director struck a massive bolt with his last stroke of genius

Jaws

They were wrong

This set has excellent behind-the-scenes extras

including the classic 1977 Watch the Skies featurette that was shown in cinemas (finally transferred here in HD

)

a complete 1997 retrospective produced by Laurent Bouzereau

and some new interviews with Spielberg

also produced and directed by Bouzerau

that shed new \"light\" on the whole project

A must-have for any serious cinephile
