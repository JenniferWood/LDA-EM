I grew up in the same neighborhood Eastside HS is in

and several friends of mine were students there

I was about 12 when I first saw the movie

While some of his character shifts in the film made me wonder if Clark was good or weird or good again

it didnt matter too much

Morgan Freeman did an incredible job in this movie

(The Real Dr

Napier and others make cameo appearences) Although much of the events and intensity was over-hyped Hollywood style for the film (the violence depicted wasn't That bad in real life

the mayor wasn't the cartoon character you saw

all the HS kids rallying for his release



hahah get real)





the Overall message of self-worth

and discipline hit the nail on the head and was moving to say the least

The film itself was a little too cliche

and kinda corny in some areas



but I liked it
