I liked it ever since seeing it on the big screen at a drive-in theater

Its a great addition to my small but building collection

I lost my everything several yrs back

so now i have have a steady home again so im rebuiding my movie collection and close encounters is a great addition i highly reccomend a copy of Close Encounters of th 3rd kind for anybody
