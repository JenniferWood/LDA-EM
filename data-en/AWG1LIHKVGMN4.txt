It starts A giant egg has washed up on shore after A large storm

and of course no one knows where it came from our what it is

But like always GODZILLA turns up

and starts destroying everything in sight

Its soon discovered that the egg belongs to MOTHRA

and that's unborn will soon hatch

The special effects where alright the cast was OK

and the screener was OK as well
