I love this film

A troubled mother of two teenagers goes to her high school's 20th anniversary reunion

The problem is she is going through a bad divorce she does

but doesn't

want while convincing herself she does

Her husband shows up and emotionally she goes into collapse and finally passes out only to wake up in the 1960s and a high school student all over again

But she is determined to do it differently
