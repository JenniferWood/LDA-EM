I was interested in this movie because I love the novel Les Miserables by Victor Hugo (and have read it several times)

I like Liam Neeson (\"Schindler's List\")

Geoffrey Rush (\"Shakespeare In Love\")

Uma Thurman (\"Dangerous Liaisons

\" \"Pulp Fiction\") and Claire Danes (the stinking pile of cow dung known as \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\")

The trailer also intrigued me

though i'm upset by the fact that a scene in the trailer showing Jean Valjean falling on his knees and tearing his yellow passport was cut from the film

At 2/1/2 hours

the movie simply does not do justice to the novel

which runs over 1000 pages

niether has the well-regarded 1935 version starring Frederic March and Charles Laughton

nor has any other version (at least that I'm aware of)

the only one that comes really close is the one starring Jean Gabin

I don't know about the miniseries starring Gerard Depardieu

as that's not available in Region 1

whoever wrote the screenplay obviously did not read the novel thoroughly; he just took what he thought would appeal to teenagers and mixed it into a screenplay

Just read the book and don't bother watching a film version of this magnificent story of one man's long hard road to redemption

I recommend the unabridged version published by Signet Classics and the well-cut version published by Barnes And Noble

This movie is rated PG-13
