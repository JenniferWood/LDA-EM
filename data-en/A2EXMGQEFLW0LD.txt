This flick is the 3rd or 4th in the 90s series reviving Godzilla and the other monsters

It is more colorful and action-packed than the original and with fuller sub-plots and twists

A meteorite crashes into the Pacific

awakening Godzilla and Battra

a vengeful dark version of Mothra

On a trip to Infant Island to review the ecological damage done by careless development

the main characters discover a gian egg and the remains of an ancient civilization and the Earth Cosmos

twins who personify the Earth

They tell of an ancient battle between Battra and Mothra

Battra was created by Earth

a living organism

to avenge the damage done by humans

Mothra defeats Battra but the battle detroys the civilization and melts the polar ice caps

The egg is Mothra's

While towing the egg to Japan

Godzilla appears and attacks the egg but Mothra escapes and tries to battle

Then Battra appears and fights Godzilla while Mothra wisely swims away

The two clash in a terrific underwater battle that causes an earthquake

The Cosmos are kidnapped and summon Mothra's aid

who wrecks Tokyo recuing them

Mothra metamorphosizes into the adult Mothra while Battra does the same

The two fight but Godzilla appears and attacks Battra

Mothra comes to Battra's aid and the two defeat Godzilla temporarily

WHile carrying Godzilla

he awakens and kills Battra and the 2 fall into the sea

Mothra flies away into space to stop an oncoming meteor

The flick has a strong ecological message but it fails in many ways

Why is Godzilla even in this flick

Why did Mothra and battra become allies

It glosses over the idea of the ancient civilization

possibly MU

which was Megalon's domain but they didn't bring Megalon back

The special effects are terrific

including Mothra's laser antennae but they're not enough to make this one a winner

As far as the series goes

Mothra's flight takes Godzilla's DNA into space which sets the stage for Space Godzilla so get it to complete the series
