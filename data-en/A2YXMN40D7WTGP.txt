The little known AAGPBL is given it's due (like the Negro Leagues) in a time where activities such as Professional Baseball belonged in the arena of White Males

The movie is shown as a Hollywood glamor style

glorification of our national pastime

such as &quot;the Natural&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;

The weight of the movie is dependent on strength of it's characters and those actors who play them

and it is mostly successful

Penny Marshall gets great performances from Tom Hanks

Rosie O'Donnell

Maddonna

David Straithern and the rest of the team

However

Geena Davis gives a detached performance and this is not good for the main protagonist

You get the feeling that her character Dottie loves baseball

but doesn't really want to be there

Her sister

Kit

played by Lori Petty is annoying

but as the role was written

Petty does a good job

The story on the other hand is pure standard soap opera cheese

This puts the challenge on Penny Marshall's shoulders

While she does not shy away from the sappy cheese

but she keeps the movie from becoming derivative

She gives us interesting characters

whether it's first billed &quot;All the Way&quot; Mae (Madonna) or secondary characters like Betty &quot;Spaghetti&quot;

played by Marshall's daughter

Tracy Reiner

And the ending

while a little bittersweet

and totally coated in sugar

never feels contrived

I have a feeling

when I reach their age

I will look at photo's of my glorified youth with the same reverence as these ladies

I especially liked the baseball game at the end

A League of their own is a movie the whole family can watch (even though it has some questionable language) and feel good that America so quickly accepted women as players in a sport that achieves religion with many people

Rating: B+Note: Get the widescreen version

the pan and scan moves around too much
