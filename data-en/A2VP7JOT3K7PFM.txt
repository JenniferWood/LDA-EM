+++++The title of this movie is actually one of the classifications used to classify the reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)

A six-fold classification was developed in the late 1950s:(1) Nocturnal lights: bright lights seen at night

(2) Daylight disks: usually oval or disk-like

(3) Radar visual: visual sightings detected by radar

(4) Close encounters of the first kind: visual sightings of an UFO

(5) Close encounters of the second kind: visual sightings plus physical effects on animate or inanimate objects

(6) ** Close encounters of the third kind: sightings of occupants in or around the UFO

There is also another category not on this list:Close encounters of the fourth kind: actual physical contact with the occupants of UFOs is made

The movie was written and directed by Steven Spielberg

He explains his movie:\"I wanted to make a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with his experience

\"This movie focuses on three main characters:(1) Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss): He is an everyday kind of guy that has a materialistic wife (Teri Garr) and three children

He has an experience that makes him obsessed with aliens

(This is the person Spielberg is talking about above

)(2) Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon

who earned a supporting actress nomination): She is a single mother whose young son

Barry (Cary Guffey)

was abducted by an alien spacecraft

She thus also becomes obsessed with aliens

(3) Claude Lacombe (played by the great French moviemaker Francois Truffaut): This character is based on a real-life UFO expert

Lacombe is a U

N

scientist who is in-charge of a mostly American team investigating unexplained phenomenon on Earth

All three of these characters meet and experience (with others) an extraordinary event--First Contact

Note that this movie

as can be deduced from its title

focuses on an encounter of the third kind but encounters of other kinds do occur in this movie

In my opinion

of all the actors

Richard Dreyfuss as the obsessed Roy Neary does an excellent job

The genius of this movie is that we don't find out until the end whether the aliens are hostile or not

The special effects are remarkable for the time especially at the end

Actually much of this movie does not have major special effects until its end where the fantastic effects easily stand up to those of today

This brings up another point: this is an intelligent sci-fi movie where the special effects have a purpose and are not simply used for display

The background music is especially good

It garnered an Academy Award nomination

This movie in total had eight Academy Award nominations and one win for Best Cinematography

The only problem I had with the story is that it seems to drag a bit during its middle scenes

Finally

the DVD (collector's edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality

It has a few extras

all of which are interesting

In conclusion

if you want to see what it feels like to experience First Contact

then I strongly recommend viewing this captivating movie
