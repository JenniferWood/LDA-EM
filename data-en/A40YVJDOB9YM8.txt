This was a great flick that had action from start to finsh

If you like a lot of shootouts

car crashes

and SUPER HOT women like Natasha Henstridge then you will love this movie

The director Ringo Lam (from Replicant) does a great job with all the camera angles

The best angles were when JCVD does his shooting and the stunts were amazing

This is plain and simply a great movie
