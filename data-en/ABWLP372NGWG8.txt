I am a consummate fan of the novel \"Les Miserables\" having read it in both its abridged version several times and the unabridged version at least once

This is a story which can be appreciated for not only being a thrilling and deeply emotional one but a philosophical and spiritual one as well

Having read the novel

and having seen several screen and television versions

as well as the staged musical version six times in nearly twenty years

I consider myself qualified to critique this particular version

I enjoyed this film with certain reservations those being the performances of Claire Daines as Cosette and Hans Matheson as Marius

They both appeared to lack the depth of understanding and the emotional investiment to portray a pair of lovers who were literally beyond their years in maturity

On the other hand

Liam Neeson as Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as Javert were superb in portraying both the long suffering hero and the archtypical villian

The key to both these characters is the individual decisions which they both make as they approached the turning points in both their own lives

With Valjean having been shown kindness and compassion from a kindly old bishop

becomes a kind and virtuous soul himself while Javert being born of a criminal and a prostiute in prison is trying to redeem his circumstance at virtually every turn for something that truly wasn't his fault







his birth

Uma Thurman was equal to the task of playing the abandoned but hopeful Fantine whose short

tragic life is made whole upon her death by Valjean's promise to her that he would spend his remaining days caring for her beloved child Cosette

All in all

and I must agree with a previous reviewer

that the ending is rather anti-climactic and should have concluded with a more subtly nuanced one both satisfying and worth remembering

I recommend it highly
