I was only 11 years old when this first came out in 1977

Because I was so caught up in the Star Wars phenomenon

and also because I thought (being a child

mind you) that the movie story line was a bit lame (and a bit weird with the way Richard Dreyfuss's character was)

I didn't particularly care for it

Where's Luke Skywalker

Darth Vader

\"May the force will be with you

\" The Death Star

The Millenium Falcon

You get the idea

Nevertheless

I still remember those 5 notes/tones that define it

After a time

I pretty much forgot all about the movie

Until I saw it on T

V

recently

Wow

35 years have passed since its release

I now appreciate the story line much more

especially the human element of it

understanding human nature much more as a 46 year old adult now

I'm not so ga-ga about the movie as the average person

but I still do like it and think it is a good movie

Seeing such a young Richard Dreyfuss makes this movie have such a nostalgic impact

and the appreciation of the passage of time

Not to mention

Teri Garr and Melinda Dillon are such attractive ladies

Especially Melinda Dillon

what a cutie-pie



While watching the movie

I have such a crush on her
