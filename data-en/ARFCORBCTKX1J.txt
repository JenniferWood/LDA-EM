Other than to remark that this is remarkably sentimental film

of the \"How I wish aliens would come down and save humanity\" ilk

I'll limit myself to the quality of the Blu-ray transfer

This is one of the best BDs I've yet seen

essentially equalling the quality of \"The Fifth Element\" and coming close to \"The Searchers\"

It is absolutely of demo quality

with extreme sharpness and detail

and little or no visible edge enhancement

The black levels are unbelievable

Most of the time it's difficult to see any difference between the film's blacks and the letterbox banding on my Pioneer Kuro

Makes me glad I bought it
