As the title says

unbelievably good

They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt

This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph

Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from

I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real

Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him

which always worked to his benefit in the end

Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife

Asenath

The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series

Well worth sitting through
