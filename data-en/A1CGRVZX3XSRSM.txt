&quot;Godzilla vs

Mothra 2&quot; is really a girl's answer to a Godzilla movie

It stars many girl in the cast

the story line is really feminine

and Mothra is a girl

so there you are

Probobly my least favorite of the new series of movies

Hats off to Battra though

he's awsome





he's like Megalon and Mothra combined

Mothra is really un-realistic in this film

In the original &quot;Godzilla vs

Mothra&quot; (1964)

Mothra was pretty

but her head and body were a more realistic yelloish color

in here shes bright white

and you can tell her eyes have lights in them

Godzilla dosen't appear much in the movie either

which is wrong

Like alot of people

I'm very dissapointed that all these new Godzilla movies are in the awful SLP quality

The picture is blurry

the sound is muffled and just looks bad

Tri Star should be ashamed of themself

first releasing that new Godzilla movie and now releasing the better films in SLP mode

So

all in all





If you like Mothra

you will like this film

If you hate Mothra

you will hate it

and if you love both Godzilla and Mothra

it's okay

Nuff' said
