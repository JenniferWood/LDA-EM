The most telling thing about &quot;Close Encounters&quot; is that it's been out for a quarter of a century

and even Steven Spielberg doesn't feel he's *quite* gotten it right yet

The 2001 DVD print is the &quot;Collector's Edition&quot;

and is not the same as the version you remember from the movie theater

cable television

or the laserdisc (depending on how you were first introduced to the film)

As with Spielberg's later &quot;A

I

&quot; (also generally regarded as a misfire)

this is a darker science-fiction fable than you'd expect from the director

The sense of discovery and wonder is present from start to finish

in images and pictures if not so much in words

The UFO display lighting up the pitch-black Indiana sky

or soaring over the Devil's Tower

haunted my dreams for years

just from seeing the TV trailers at a young age

long before I'd watched the movie

From that stand point &quot;Close Encounters&quot; is one of our most enduring films

Less well-remembered is Richard Dreyfuss's role as Roy Neary

a man whose life is quite literally torn apart by his encounter and subsequent visions

Almost unbelievably for a Spielberg film

Neary's marriage does't survive the film (Terri Garr does at least lends unexpected depth to what could have been a thankless role)

and we're left wondering if he'll be reunited with his three children -- or if Roy Neary really cares

The one family scene before his close encounter shows that he's pretty well alienated from his home to begin with

Was he happy with his life before the flying saucers found him

Will he ever return to Earth

What does Spielberg mean by that U

S

Enterprise hanging in Roy's living room

:-)The film is rife with Spielberg's great cinematic signatures and humorous touches (the UFOs

who are first mistaken for a truck pulling up behind Roy's vehicle

lift up and fly *over* him

but he's too busy reading a map to notice)

The final half-hour of the film is virtually dialogue free -- at least

in this particular edition -- and ends in a show of lights that mirrors the look of &quot;2001&quot;'s last segment

if lacking in that earlier film's impact

The DVD transfer is

as others have said

a joy to watch

The special features are a bit repetitive -- the making-of documentary is nearly as long as the movie -- and not all the footage from all the versions of the movie have been incorporated

Most Spielberg fans will not find this to be his most cohesive work

Indeed

one day Spielberg may return to the picture yet again

But the physical package is impressive

and the 4 hours you spend with these discs are 4 hours that you don't need to spend watching &quot;A

I
