Similiarities to the Enemy Mine movie could be made here

Perhaps the Enemy Mine writer got the idea from this story

Two men stranded on a Island rather than a planet in this case

As WWII rages a Japanese and American soldier are stranded on the same small island

They try to kill each other at first

As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce

Eventually they work together and build a raft

After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands

The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation of the main island

Up to this point an excellent movie

In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting

sets

scenery

music

directing and all the rest are incredible

SPOILER ALERT: Now the reason I didn't give it four or five stars is because they kill them off with a single stray artillery shell in the original ending

You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters

Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me

If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie

they don't give much credit to the audience

Why they didn't use the alternate ending with the soldiers walking off their separate ways is beyond me

Be sure to look at the alternate ending and see if you agree this should have been the original ending

Still well worth owning
