This movie is the perfect chick flick

if we might even attempt to taint it with that moniker

If not every rugged female wants to drive her convertible over a cliff a la 'Thelma and Louise' to prove her gumption and independence

then she should pick up a baseball and fire a strike

There's something about being empowered by baseball and playing it just as hard and tough as the boys -- much less facetious than the usual wimpy challenges women face in chick flicks

Having played fast-pitch softball competitively for the last 15 years

there's a dugout somewhere in my heart for this movie
