First of all let me just say that this movie has the worst anticlimatical ending of all time: there's no verbal or telepathic communications established with the aliens

no sense of what their intentions are

no reason mentioned for why they've abducted people

no reason to explain why Richard Dreyfuss' character is the &quot;chosen one&quot;

and worst of all we (the audience) are left to believe that a stupid little hand gesture means that everything is all hunky-dory with the aliens- case closed

everything is all right with the aliens because Steven Spielberg says so

Don't worry about cattle mutilations or any of those other violent abductions you've been hearing about

everything's all fine and dandy

The first half of the movie was good

but for some reason they decided to turn it into some watered-down

cheesy

leave-the-audience-feeling-secure kind of movie during the last half

Another reviewer mentioned the movie 2001 and compared it to Close Encounters

all I have to say is that they're completely different from each other- one has a philosophical message and one doesn't

Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about

2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though

)

but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters
