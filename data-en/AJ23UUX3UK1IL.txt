This is truly a classic

This movie kind of makes us all believe in close encounters

and that it could happen to us

or what if



Very enjoyable

Steven is an excellent writer and story teller

I bet sitting around a camp fire he could spin a tale

and everyone present would be sitting there with goose bumps

their eyes wide open

their jaws dropped down to their chest

Keep writing Steven

And keep making movies
