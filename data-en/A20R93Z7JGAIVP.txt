We've had this movie for years on VHS and finally decided to go DVD

The film is so funny and really showcases Ms MacLaine's talent as the grumpy old lady character

Nicholas Cage's uptight Secret Service agent is very well done as well

His character shines well through the movie as we see the little cracks to the real person under the suit
