This is the best movie of all time

I have probably watched it 20+ times

The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph

There are some fillers added but

if there weren't

the movie would be too short

It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end

Parents please be aware that

even though this is a family story

there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting

really) Joseph

These scenes may not be appropriate for children

When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing

you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn
