This one comes with a beautiful book full of great pictures and information

I love that the menu lets you choose which version you want to see (original

special

and director's cut)

The image quality is great for a movie from the 70s

It is full of extra material

documentaries

photo galleries

and everything you could ask for

Maybe a commentary with director & cast would have made it perfect

but it's ok

I was lucky to purchase this one now

because in a short time it will be impossible to find at this price
