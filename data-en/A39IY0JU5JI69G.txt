For some reason the review I submitted right after seeing this DVD didn't make it onto the website so I'm writing another

Since it's not fresh in my mind I'll just add my \"vote\" to the others who recommend this

To me

some stories are worth telling and some aren't

This is one that is

And it's brilliantly filmed and acted

Others' have recounted the story so I won't repeat it

But it's a tale of substance

worth your time and attention
