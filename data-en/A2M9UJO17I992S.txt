I remember watching this when I was younger--and my husband had never seen it

It was just as good as I remember it

and the scene with Barry being abducted still creeped me out (my husband agreed it was intense)

We enjoyed watching it together

and it will be something we will definitely watch again

And my husband agrees that it's important NOT to trust the aliens





regardless of what happened

:-)
