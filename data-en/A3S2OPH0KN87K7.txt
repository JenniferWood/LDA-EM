I like this movie where they can make fun of the secret service even though they do have a tough strict job

Its no walk in the park for them

great chemistry by cage and maclaine

If you to want to sit back and watch a good saturday noon movie throw it in and laugh a bit

you might want to get ' My blue Heaven ' as well

Thanks Wally
