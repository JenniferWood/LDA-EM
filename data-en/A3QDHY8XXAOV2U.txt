If somebody asked me about great baseball movies

this movie would be the first one that I would mention

Anybody could watch this movie

Both baseball fans and non baseball fans would equally enjoy it

I was not a baseball fan when I saw it on the 15th birthday in 1992

However

the movie made me laugh so hard

Jon Lovitz

Tom Hanks

the little boy

and everyone else in the cast were so funny

They had me rooting for the Rockford Peaches
