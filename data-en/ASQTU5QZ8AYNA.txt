For whatever reason

I have no clue as to why this film does not get praised enough

It truely one of the most realisic roles that any actor of any race that has ever been portrayed

Morgan Freeman's portrayel of the strict Principal Joe Clark just blows ya away

He not only becomes Joe Clark

he becomes the character within

he use sly & slick phrases that get attention of the viewer

He is by far his most underrated performance without any recognition

The critics however always ramblin on and write off the good movies like Lean on Me

so I believe that's why it's gets this rap

Lets not also forget that aside from Morgan Freeman there was a great cast

and superb director

If more principals in schools around the country could be more like Joe Clark

I think there would be less violence and more obidience

and we would benefit and prospere
