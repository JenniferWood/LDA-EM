A 70's favorite of ours

Lots of funny characters who go to church together and attempt to oust the gambling element in their town with the help of their new pastor

Chase scenes will give you a good laugh

Hilarious finale involves an all out demolition derby between church ladies and the bad guys with the expected happy ending in spite of broken nails and wrecked cars

This was in an era when churches were just beginning to loosen up with their music and may seem corny in some ways

but still a lot of fun
