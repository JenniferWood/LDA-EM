I thought that the DVD version of Close Encounters is a fine presentation of the film with very good extras

My only problem is with the crumby package the discs are stored in

I've only opened it a handfull of times but it's already starting to show stress points between the 2 disc containers

Simalar (but better designed) packaging used for &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and the 2 disc version of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; would have been a better choice all-around

So

by all means buy the disc but be aware of the flimsy packaging design
