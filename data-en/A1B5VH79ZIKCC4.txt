What's not to like

Except the ending





Jesus

who wrote that ending

Marvin a real Marine in WWII who actually killed Japanese on Guadalcanal as a 19 year old

played a total realistic part

Mifume

the greatest actor to ever come out of Japan plays a smart realistic soldier

I cannot add more that what others have written on here
