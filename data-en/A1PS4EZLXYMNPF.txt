I've always loved this movie ever since it came out in theaters in 1992

I had bought the first DVD to get the film in the original 2

35:1 widescreen aspect ratio (the pan-and-scan TV version is simply missing too much

)

but that was all the first DVD had to offer that was worth anything

THIS time however

we are treated to a second disc chock FULL of great bonus features

It has interviews and behind-the-scenes materials

as well as a LOAD of deleted scenes (15 of them in all)

Disc one also has a feature-length commentary track by Penny Marshall and some of the actresses too

What is there to complain about then

you ask

Well

it has to do with the deleted scenes

Don't get me wrong

the ones that are here pretty much include everything that was in the later revised draft of the script and fill in some minor holes in the theatrical version (which become more apparent AFTER you've seen these scenes

) But

there is at least one more scene that was deleted that is NOT presented even here

and I have no idea why

I do know that the scene was deleted from the script even while some of the others that are on this disc were still present

but the mystery scene MUST have been finished

The reason why I say that is because a small clip from it was used during the end credits

It's the scene where Kit was practicing her pitching and Dottie was catching on the edge of the field near the road leading up to their parent's house

The way it read in the script was that the infamous \"Mitch Swaley\" drove up while they were out there and asked Kit out

She accepted his invitation

albeit somewhat reluctantly

The scene obviously belonged right before the existing scene where the two sisters are walking up the drive and Kit was complaining about her strikeout at the game that day

Note that Dottie is carrying the gloves

and she also ribs Kit about Mitch Swaley liking her

Since the clip during the credits was clean and finished

doesn't it make sense that the entire scene would be also and could have been included here

Some of the deleted scenes here were lifted from an early \"working-print\" according to Penny Marshall

and as such they are not as clean and bright as finished scenes are

I was looking forward to finally getting to see the entire scene that was hinted at in the end credits

but it did not happen for some inexplicable reason

Other than that

this DVD is a dream come true for anyone who enjoys this movie

There will likely not be any further releases for this one

so this is the one to buy
