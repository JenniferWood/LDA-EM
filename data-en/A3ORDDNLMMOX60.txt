Yes

this movie is a little corny and slow at the beginning

And it doesn't meet today's \"standards\" for a comedy

But it is so funny

I miss the traditional Disney movies of the 60's

Even Disney has comprised their standards and morals over the past few years

I would recommend this family movie to anyone
