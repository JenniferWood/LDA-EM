This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account

than any we've yet seen







it's very emotional and very encouraging as well

Long film

but not too long

The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph

He's seen from waist up

in a pool relazing/bathing

and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually

Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest

until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes

for real)

Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so







\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him

We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was

but never noticed this part until this year

Why

because we had younger children at the time

and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds

We didn't do that this year

and WHOOOAH



We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments

They don't show below the water

but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening

For this reason

i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it

If i had this film on VCR

i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film

)

It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree

they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way

at that time

However

they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments

This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers







which is TOTALLY TRASHY





taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it

My family was apalled

)

Again

i say if you cannot edit the movie

DON'T BUY IT
