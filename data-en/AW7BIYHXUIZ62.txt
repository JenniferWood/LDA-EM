Somehow I missed this 1997 sleeper until I caught it recently on late night TV

I have since ordered a copy of the video to keep and an additional one to share with friends

You can read about the plot elsewhere so I won't re-write it

The main character (Chad) commits such acts of cruelty my jaw dropped

It is so politically incorrect (the interview with the black employee)my jaw dropped

There are multiple surprise twists

up to the last minute

Funny -- disgusting -- heartbreaking

Watch this one
