Normally

arthouse movies like this consists of style

tons of babble and VERY unlikable characters (I

E

&quot;HurlyBurly&quot;

&quot;Basquait&quot;

any Quentin Tarrantino movie

and my personal

sincere favorite &quot;HEAT&quot;)

What I like about them is that they are something new from what you would find from the average movie theater and what you get out of all that babble is a message (except with that godawful HurlyBurly)

&quot;In a Company of Men&quot; was slow at the beginning

but give it time

I saw a sinister love triangle and felt a smidge guilty when I laughed at the sleaziest moments

Because of this

I call this an artsy

dark toned

less cartoonish version of &quot;Something About Mary&quot;
