Classic movie

A bit lame by today's hyped up super-graphic laden movie

but this was the forerunner of them all

In the final scenes

the scientist in charge of UFOs and alien investigations (in real life)

who coined the phrase

&#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#34; is in the movie (the tall scientist who is the first one to meet an alien)

Make sure you don't have fine crystal on your speaker cabinets as this movie

in places

will bounce them right off because of the intense audio vibrations
