There is a chilling scene in this brilliant film in which a misogynistic man

after having pretended to fall in love with a frail

deaf woman and finally coldly told her the truth

says to her

&quot;So how does it make you feel inside at this moment

knowing what you do

It hurts that much

Then I guess I must be going; the deed is done

&quot; You may notice that during this cruel psychological assault

the deaf woman at one point looks away from him

and (thankfully) may not have heard all he has said to her

But that's beside the point

The psychological assault is targeted at US

The movie is asking us

how does THAT make us feel inside

The triumph of the movie (apart from being made by first-time writer-director Neil LaBute with only a $25

000 budget) is that it unrelentingly confronts us with the most callous and apathetic of human behavior and makes us think about OUR behavior in the real world

It paints a frightening picture of moral decay

relational malaise

emotional backruptcy that is increasingly common in our society at large
