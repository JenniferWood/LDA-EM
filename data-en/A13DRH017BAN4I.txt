As entertainment

this movie works

Geena Davis

especially

makes it worth watching

(Hanks

too

I guess

although I seem to be one of the few people who think he's a bit overrated)

As history and as a message movie -- it fails

For starters

in the first year of the AAGPBL

they played softball

not baseball

Some of the actors were convincing as ballplayers; others were not

In the latter category was Lori Petty

When she pitched

she would grunt and throw out her right leg to make it look as if she were really throwing a fireball in there

But if you watch the ball instead of her

it's clear that her \"fast ball\" is going about 20 mph

But my main complaint is in the \"message\"; which

I guess

is that women can do anything men can do

Sure

But Penny Marshall undermined that concept with the fact that

in the movie

the league only became popular after a sexy shot of \"Dottie Hinson\" catching a foul while doing a split was published in Life magazine

and after the team members started rewarding men who caught foul balls with a kiss

So the true message seems to be: Men will watch womens' sports if the participants are good-looking

and if there are no mens' sporting events to watch

That pretty much sums up today's LPGA tour

So here's the key: Stop looking for a \"you go girls\" message

Enjoy a moderately charming and funny film

And you'll be okay
