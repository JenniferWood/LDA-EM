This

by far

is my favorite Steven Spielberg movie and is absolutely one of my favorite films out of the entire history of cinema

This is one that could be enjoyed even by those who hate science fiction films

The plot is amazing and

in my opinion

this film needs to be regarded as the standard setting sci-fi film of the 70's

just as 2001: A Space Odyssey was in the 60's

Also

the acting was just astounding

especially on the part of Richard Dreyfus

In conclusion I wanted to add in response to the reviewer below that it is more like good riddance to a witch of a wife

Teri Garr did a splendid job of playing a wife who's head was completely in the sand and was not supportive of her husband at all

I mean

if I had a loser wife like this

then I would be really tempted

alien encounter or not

to trash my living room and build a replica of Devil's Tower in my living room so she would think I was crazy and would leave me





FOR GOOD



Or

better yet

have the aliens abduct her

harvest her organs so they could see what a LOUSY EARTHLING WIFE IS MADE OF



Anyway

all ranting aside

this film is highly entertaining very awe-inspiring
