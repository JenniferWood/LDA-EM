Summary: Godzilla wages war against a giant moth and her offspring

Over all

a good movie with above average monster effects

music

and acting (for this kind of movie that is)

Not to be confused with the later '90s version &quot;Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth&quot;

Next is &quot;Ghidrah

the Three-Headed Monster&quot;
