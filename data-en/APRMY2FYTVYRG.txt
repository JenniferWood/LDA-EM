I was sorely disappointed with this movie

I loved it when I was a kid

but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres

I just wasn't impressed at all

I saw the DVD and couldn't resist

but I wish I would have

This has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen

Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion

but this is pathetic

At least Jaws and E

T

have some action throughout the entire movie

Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning

1

25 hours of boredom

and an ending that just wasn't nearly as good as it was when I was kid

My kids couldn't stand it

so it's obviously not a timeless classic

like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s
