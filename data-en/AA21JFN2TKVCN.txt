Considering that I rank the first Omega Code as the single worst movie I have ever seen in my life

an unmitigated disaster

I was quite prepared to hate this

Ignoring the automatic raves that TBN's movies always seem to get

many early reviews I read were not encouraging

I sat all the way through the first one

for some reason

and was not going to make that mistake again

This film does have problems

It's better-written than Omega Code but only just

Its &quot;symbolic&quot; moments often make this next-to incoherent

Michael York chews too much scenery

The battle scenes were rather amateurish and went on way too long

My Lord and Savior still doesn't put in an appearance(odd for a Christian movie)

And there are others

But with all that in mind

I have to admit something

Matt Crouch is learning

This is a FAR better movie than Omega Code

Granted

that's not saying much(nowhere to go but up)

But Trenchard-Smith is a much better director than Robert Macarelli and knows how to keep things moving

The story

although it took a little too long to get going and was a bit jumbled at times

was a good one and kept me to the end

There are some frightening moments here

Michael Biehn is a very underrated actor

light years better than Casper Van Dien

and steals this thing away from Michael York

The computer-generated Satan

although a bit obvious

was done very well

And

although you don't see the Winner of the fight

you do get to see Satan bow the knee to Him and then be cast into hell and bound

which rather got to many of the people I saw this with

Revelations is still too broad a story to do in one rather short movie

And it needs FAR more money than TBN has spent on it

I hope TBN leaves off blockbusters for a while in favor of smaller

managable stories with Christian messages

They've shown they can do a reasonably good job

Although this movie is not great

it was not the disaster I was expecting and is worth a look
