Great cast of actors

After seeing the musical film this year

nothing impacts me the same

I like the older rendition with Michael Rennie better

This one did not touch on Gods redemption like the others

especially the musical which left me in tears

This one left me feeling more emotionless

because that is really what this movie is about is redemption
