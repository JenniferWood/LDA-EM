This movie paints a compelling and complex portrait of three vastly different characters

Other reviewers have written about the plot

so I won't bore you by repeating what's already been said

Suffice to say that it is fascinating to watch how each person behaves in this situation

The sweet deaf secretary who is at first so shy and unsure of herself

but who blossoms thanks to the attentions of two suiters and -- ultimately -- is disgusted and crushed by the truth

Then the beta male

the guy who isn't really quite cut out for the cut-throat nature of the business world or of such a nasty competition

And finally

the alpha male

the orchestrator

whose strategic mind and utter lack of compassion allows him to flourish in his competitive world

A good movie

and well worth watching
