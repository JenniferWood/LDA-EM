All of the main characters are wonderful and the smaller parts are also very well acted

Another BBC success

I recently watched Michael Kitchen in Foyle's War and loved it so looked for more w/ him

This doesn't disappoint

Ah

the 4th disc (The Sequel) is broad comedy with some guffaw moments and is just as good as the first 3 episodes

it's still drama though
