How coincidental that this program

aired by ABC in 1979

is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 30 years later

in 2009

experiencing an economic malaise of our own

I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character

Benedict Slade

really is





Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr

Winkler

The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts

Being a fan of \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens

I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production
