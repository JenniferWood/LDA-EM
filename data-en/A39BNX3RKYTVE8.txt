I wondered if the disk had the original ending or the \"extended\" ending that came out a few years after the theatrical version

Well

it has the theatrical version ending; the extended \"inside the ship\" ending is included in the extra scenes chapter

Better this way

IMO

since the original leaves the sense of unknown in the viewer

And the inside of the ship was kind of simplistic anyway - it looks like rock concert lights
