This is a fine movie

It has all the ingredients a good comedy should

without much profanity or anything

All the players did a good job--my favorites are Tom Hanks

who of course wanted nothing to do withgirls playing MLB

He had the best line when he got mad at an outfielder for not hitting cutoff &#34;man&#34; or somethinglike that

Anyhow she started crying and he yells &#34; THERE'S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL&#34;

Geena Davis is so goodand so beautiful

I think Hanks and Madonna steal the show

each in his/her own way

Get this movie

You willnever be disappointed

Mary Waters
