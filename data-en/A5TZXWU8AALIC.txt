I saw this movie when it was first released and loved its performances and messages

The inspirational story

based on the controversial Joe Clark

gives the movie an authenticity that pays off

After all these years

I'm watching it again and appreciating what a great performance we get from Morgan Freeman

Every line

every expression--just priceless

Rolling his eyes as he reads answers over a student's shoulder during a test made me laugh out loud

His nonstop rants against students

teachers

parents

pretty everybody are both funny and powerful

Around this same time

Freeman put out two other movies

One was GLORY

The speech he gives as a former slave-turned-soldier at the campfire before the big climactic battle brought tears to my eyes

The other movie was STREET SMART with Christopher Reeve

Freeman plays a pimp who blackmails Reeve for an alibi and he's absolutely chilling

That an actor can go from powerful righteousness to pure evil in two movies is amazing

LEAN ON ME is a good movie with a wonderful message

But it's a great performance from one of our finest American actors
