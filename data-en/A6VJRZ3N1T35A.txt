The first time I saw this movie I was amazed at the liberties the director and writers took with regards to the treatment of women in general

and especially the lead female character

In a day and age where people knock each other over to be politically correct

it is nice to see someone push the envelope and make a funny

crass and disturbing movie which will offend nearly everyone

Although I liked the movie I can only give it 4 stars (out of 5) due to the weak ending

I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary

and who does not mind a little (OK a lot) dark humor
