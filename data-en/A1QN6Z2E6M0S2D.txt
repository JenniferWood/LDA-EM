This is a review of the Blu-ray version

Generally

everything looks fine

The Blu-Ray is a definite 90% improvement

but there are scenes that don't really look much better that the original DVD

This movie has always been hampered by the highly compressed nature of the audio

especially the score

Unfortunately

what we have here is no improvement

You would think that with all of the effort that goes into so-called \"ultimate\" versions

they could have gone in to touch-up some of the film's score

Case in point

is over the end credits

Compare what you hear with John Williams recording with the Boston Pops which includes the new material from the Special Edition version

By Request: The Best Of John Williams And The Boston Pops OrchestraThe difference is stunning

But

alas





There is one downside (and I admit that this is probably nit-picking) but Criterion's CAV laserdisc version was so wonderful since one could program (edit) the movie into what I (

) felt was the ultimate version

With all 3 versions on the Blu-Ray

frankly

I do not find one to be completely satisfying

If we only had the original version

there would be no issue; nothing to compare

too

But

with 3 versions

one sees things that could have been improved to make (what I think) is a true ultimate version

But

again

alas





I love this movie

The excitement and sense of wonder has always given me goosebumps

If you have a Blu-Ray

right now

this is the only version to own
