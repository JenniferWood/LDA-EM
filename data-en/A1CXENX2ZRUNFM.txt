My favorite movie

hands down

It's merited my favor simply because of it's stunning visual effects

which still hold up wonderfully during this age of increasing use of CG effects

Everything from lens flares to the dazzling colors to thetwinkling starfields are all there in their digital glory

Still

having seen most versions of the film with it's variousedits and changes

I still wish for the complete version of the film with all scenes intact

Also

the documentary seems to have a few scenes missing that were on the collector's widescreen edition(VHS)

such as alien sequences and test prints not used in the film

Also

it sure is hard to read those subtitles inwidescreen

I should not gripe

though

The movie is a long-awaited addition to my DVD collection

and the extensive behind-the-scenes sections and deleted scenes sections more than make upfor any flaws

Why be a completist

Enjoy the movie
