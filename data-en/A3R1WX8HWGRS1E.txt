Still a classic movie and fun to watch after all these years

Sure

there are some parts that are a little \"goofy\"

but since we really haven't made first contact yet

(that we know of)we really don't know what to expect

Lets just hope they're as friendly as the ones in the movie

A big thumbs up from me
