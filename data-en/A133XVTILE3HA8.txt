Close Encounters is one of those Spielberg movies where you can really feel the magic

It isn't a downer

and it isn't the kind of movie that makes you think about the world's problems

Even the US government seems to have the best intentions when it comes to the aliens

The whole movie wears a little smirk on it's face

Masterfully done

Encounters has some simple but effective visual effects and a emotional and powerful soundtrack

The casting is good considering it was early in the careers of several of the people involved

Richard Dreyfuss plays his character perfectly

Roy Neary is a regular joe that suddenly is confronted with some life changing events that he can't understand

The messages that he is getting in his head confuse him all the more and Dreyfuss does a perfect job of illustrating that

The supporting cast turns in good performances as well and really give the impression that you are watching a documentary rather than a work of fiction

The best parts of the movie in my opinion is when they are showing you clips from around the world of different UFO encounters and the research team finding evidence of an alien presence

When they're in the Mongolian desert and they find the freighter Cotopoxi

The same ship that was lost for real in the Bermuda Triangle

It still gives me chills

They slowly pan across and you see a huge ship sitting in the middle of the sand

Oooooh man

great shot

Bottom Line: This is another one of Spielberg's classics

You must get it on DVD for the multitude of extras that are on the 2 disc set

If you haven't seen it yet and you like either UFO's and/or Spielberg

you won't be disappointed
