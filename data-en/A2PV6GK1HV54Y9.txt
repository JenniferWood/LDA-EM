A League of Their Own directed by Penny Marshall isn't a perfect comedy or sports film but it's good enough thanks to the talented cast

Tom Hanks is perfectly appropriate for this kind of film

he is an alcoholic manager of an all-women baseball team

Geena Davis and Lori Petty play sisters who very much love each other but are highly competitive

And how can you not love Madonna

her song This Used to be my Playground is played at the end of the film

Give this film a viewing sometime

enjoy
