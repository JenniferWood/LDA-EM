Incredible movie in my opinion

but the dry

stage-play-like atmosphere

the Mamet-influenced sense of dialogue

and the shamelessly offensive actions and lines of the main characters are not for everyone

If you're a fan of Mamet or stark

dialogue-driven films

and your sensibilities aren't too delicate and easy to upset

you will probably find this film captivating

Others will find it horridly offensive

although that is partially the point

Some may just find it dull and meaningless

But who cares about them

They are dumb

: ) It isn't a feel-good film

certainly not a film to watch with a date

but if you're patient

level-headed

imaginative

a fan of the aforementioned Mamet-esque style

and not easily offended

you will probably love it

Stringent requirements

perhaps

but that's why this film has a small cult following rather than a huge mainstream fan base
