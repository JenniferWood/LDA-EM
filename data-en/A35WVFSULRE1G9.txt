Spielberg's vision of the outerworld is brilliant and captavating

The film is long

but it demands attention

Stephen wrote this and directed it

Dreyfuss is good

but a little to strong in his character

Melinda Dillon as the single mother who loses her son to the aliens is brilliant

so is Teri Garr

This film makes you think

can the government actually pull this off







After seeing this

I believe it

The DTS version is incredible

the scene where Barry

(little boy)

is abducted

is just out right crazy and loud

Dreyfuss

(a man on a mission)

has had a close encounter

is out to find out where and why

Believe me

if this was you

you would have sleepless nights

Dialogue is good

FX

is incredible for 1977

and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC

Spielberg's 3rd feature film is a breakthrough

and one mans drive and vision of his childhood dreams

Spielberg is the man

and he was only 28 then

War of the Worlds basically relies on CGI effects

still fun

but this is the best(friendly) alien encounter film ever

Hope that didn't spoil anything

Entertaining

hands down

or up

if your reaching for the dark skys
