The idea of an \"everyman\" confronting aliens is a great plot device

but Spielberg's ham fisted direction sinks this project

It COULD have been a classic

I was rather taken with it back when it played first-run

but now I can see that the effects work of Doug Trumbull and the music of John Williams were what really kept this afloat initially

Also

this blu-ray looks grainier than the theatrical presentation
