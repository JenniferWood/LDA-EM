This is a very tedious and unfunny riff on the \"fish out of water\" films that were so popular in the 1980's

It is about this Major League Geek Astronomer Scientist played by Dan Aykroyd who falls in love with an Alien woman played by Kim Basinger

After watching this movie one can only come to the conclusion that good Comedic Acting is an Alien Concept to Ms

Basinger

This movie is redeemed soley by the performance of Jon Lovitch who has excellent taste in cars and is the only funny guy in this entire movie

I give this movie 5 stars because thankfully Ms

Basinger has disappeared from our screens in recent years and her real life antics are a lot funnier than this movie
