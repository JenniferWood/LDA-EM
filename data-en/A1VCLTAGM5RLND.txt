Who does Joe Clark think he is just because he's the new high school principal at East Side High doesn't give him the right to kick half of the students out of school for good

They had a right to stay in school not learn any education also bringing drugs

guns

knives

cutting class

and starting fights is just their way of being a teenager & having fun

He defentaly went over board by making students singing some stupid school & learning it or else get sent to detention

What gives him the right to suspend a teacher he doesn't have that power only the school board

It gets even worst he has the nerve to chain and lock all school doors during class time to keep the other kids that he kicked out in the beinging

thats not fair to them

Now this one will take the cake of what all I said

this man makes all the faculity staff go in the jim and raise their hands and turn around and look at one another he's not their daddy

What is really sad about this is this movie is base on a true story
