I too am a Spielberg child

Forget &#34;Gravity&#34;

which had no message other than it's dangerous to fool around in space

&#34;Close Encounters&#34; instead

has a true message of hope of a future peaceful encounter with extraterrestials

Richard Dreyfus

Mellinda Dillon and the child Carey Guffey

who was only three years old when he was casted

steal the show and the viewer's hearts

I just saw it again on TV last night

and rushed to get it (my copy ceased playing a long time ago)

This is the film to which I compare every single SF movie I watch

my standard of excelence
