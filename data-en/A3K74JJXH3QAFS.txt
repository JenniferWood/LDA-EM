There are two things that must be said about WKRP in Cincinatti

The first is that it was arguably the best workplace sitcom of the last thirty years

The other is that it deserves better treament for a video release than it's received thus far

For my part

I didn't really notice the absence of particular songs in the set (which has been a prized possession for years)

I was too engrossed in the episodes themselves thanks to the excellent scripts and performances

That said

I would probably be willing to pay a few bucks more to pay for having the original music choices reinstated

The notion that the absence of the original songs is somehow a justification for piracy

however

is just madness

Putting aside the fact that it's criminal

it's also illogical as it punishes the people whose work these \"fans\" claim to admire so much

If one truly loves and respects the work of the many talented people who made WKRP

then they should realize that buying and selling pirated copies

depriving those artists of fair compensaiton for their work

is simply wrong

I love WKRP and I'll be among the first to pre-order if it finally sees the light of day

Until then

those who really respect the makers of the show (behind and in front of the camera) should be patient

A lot of music-intensive shows (Freaks & Geeks and SCTV being two examples) have managed to get on the market with their original music intact

so there's hope

I'll choose hope over self-centered criminal activity any day
