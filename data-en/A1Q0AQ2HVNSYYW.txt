The problem with most reviewers of this film is that they simply know the story too well

You'll find in most reviews(as in Amazon's editorial one above) comparisons to the Hugo novel

or comparisons to 1995 Cluade Lelouch french version in other reviews

This is unfortunate (for them)

they've simply seen to many movies and thus could never watch this one with an objective eye

I am not ashamed to say that I never saw another version of the story

nor have I read the book

and having just seen the film on video I can truly say that it is a magnificent epic

Beautifully photographed

acted and scored

The wonderfully controlled villanous performance by the great Geoffery Rush is particulary brilliant

he is a man who simply must do his job

a man who aspires to be a perfect law machine through brutality

The reason why I don't give 5 stars is that in the final third the story shifts to a somewhat less interesting story of youthful romance

but the film recovers with a great final scene

This film didn't receieve much press or hype

but I still advice you to check it out

especially if you're not familiar with the story

beause for much of the time it really soars
