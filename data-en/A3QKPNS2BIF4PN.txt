I can understand that people are upset about the movie not following the book

but review the movie for the movie

This was an excellent movie with great acting and direction

You will not be disapointed by buying this film

If you like Liam Neeson or Jeffery Rush

then this is your film

It is well written

the sets are beautiful

and the costumes great

In summery

it does what every great movie should: it suspended my disbelief
