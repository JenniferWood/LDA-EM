Even though Spielberg \"trimmed\" the film a few years after its initial release

there still remain some really slow scenes

especially at the home of stars Dreyfuss and Garr

The actors do there best to work the \"family thing\" but the scenes are prolonged and drag the story line

More effective are the ones with Melinda Dillon and the precocious Cary Guffey as a mother and son

respectively

terrorized by nocturnal and unseen visitors

That said

the end when the Earthmen and aliens finally make contact is breathtaking

Coupled with the special effects and John Williams's magnificent score

CETK is a science fiction classic that still manages to captivate
