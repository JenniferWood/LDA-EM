Not only is this a tremendously entertaining film

it's an empowering piece of women's history in sports

I bought it for my daughter because I think it's a must-see for all girls that play sports (of any variety)

The obstacles that were overcome by these women in the 40s paved the way for later leagues such as the WNBA

WUSA

and WAFL

But -- all that aside -- this is a funny

touching film

Penny Marshall doesn't exactly do subtle emotions

so have the Kleenex handy

I dare you not to cry during the war-department telegram scene

Everybody

even Madonna

seems just about perfect in her role

I only wish that there had been more included on the DVD

maybe some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that I usually skip on other DVDs -- it would have been interesting here

Oh

look sharp during the &quot;Meet the Peaches&quot; scene

where the girls take the field for the first time to the hoots &amp; derision of the crowd

You can see Rosie do a face plant just as she turns to run to third base

Don't know why they didn't reshoot the scene

but there it is :-)
