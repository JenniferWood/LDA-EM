A very nice package for a classic film

It's nice to see that Spielberg took the time to do a nice remaster and include all the versions of the film

It's great to see how it developed over the years into what Spielberg really wanted

The picture is very crisp with some of the gloss being removed from the original

I for one really enjoy these packages where the put a number of versions of an important film together and give reasons for all the different changes

Over the course of watching these I end up changing my own choice of favorite version

Anyway a great job done on a great film

you won't be disappointed
