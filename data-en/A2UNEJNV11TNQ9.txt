This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting

Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this

The heartwarming change of his character

although well known by most

is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right

The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler

You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale
