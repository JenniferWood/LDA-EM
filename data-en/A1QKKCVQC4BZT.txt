this is a completely boring film and one of Spielberg's worst films

Usually his movies are fantastic

like Indiana Jones

Jurassic Park

or even E

T



but this so damn slow and plodding

And this is coming from someone who loved Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey

Trust me

this movie is worthless

watch it only if you want to fall asleep in front of the TV
