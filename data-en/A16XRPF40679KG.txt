amazon has once again stuck blu ray material with dvd material and vhs even leading to mass confusion andthey just won't do a thing about it

Some people are angry because one blu ray isn't the 'ulimate edition' but that's a problem when you order

as there is a ultimate edition blu ray

it's three versions of this classic movie

and they look great

That's alot of movie for the now lower prices of the blu ray package

THere is another version of this with one movie on blu so YOU have to ask your seller what version you are ordering

As for this one It's a great movie with a cool blu ray set up and that's enough for any fan of this movie

THis is a great transfer of this movie and it's grainy but that's the way it was shot

So if you want this on blu ray then get it and remember to ask what version you are getting the ultimate is three versions of the movie and the other is one

The ultimate has extra features the other one doesn't
