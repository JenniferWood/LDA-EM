This is a brilliant epic movie

a tour de force

the best Biblical movie I have seen with the exception ofOne Night with the KingStarring Paul Mercurio in the title role

he gives an intelligent and passionate performance of a man who was prepared to die

to keep to the word of his G-D

Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache

Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan

later to be Joseph's aid de camp

A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesmanThe movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar

and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife

when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her

Potiphar soon knows he is innocent

and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood

including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza)

and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him

where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders

His rise in prison

his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell)

The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest

The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way

and yes this is an adult movie

but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive
