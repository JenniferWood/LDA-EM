This film was a Hollywood version of an actual league that flourished between 1943-1954

However

there were a few instances which needed clarification

1

There was a \"trade\" of players in the middle of the film but there was no indication as to what or who was received in return

2

In the final sequence in the film

it is usually the manager which goes to the pitcher's mound rather than the catcher alone

3

When pitching to a batter

one should not pitch the same pitch three times in a row

A little variety would have been in order especially after a count of 0 and 2

4

When the catcher catches the ball from the infield in an attempt to tag out the runner at home and the catch is made ten feet ahead of the runner

the catcher should attempt to tag the runner before she touches home plate even to the extent of coming out from behind home plate rather than brace for a collision
