I really enjoyed this movie

I thought the relationship between Potifer and his wife and his wife and Joseph really striking

Several things that I had not thought of before

Such as: why didn't Potifer have Joseph killed when his wife accused him of rape

and How did his brothers react to him after he became Pharaoh's advisor
