I love this movie because of the way it moves me emotionally





down to my very core

It sounds dramatic

but the humanity

the wonder

the magic of Close Encounters





it can only be seen to be understood

This movie is timeless and has a special place in my heart

The acting is nearly flawless

It's an extreme thing to say

but the world in this film feels so entirely genuine and real because of the emotion we see conveyed on screen

The direction and writing is

of course

awesome

Special effects--still impressive

and almost more convincing than the stuff we see today

Beautiful cinematography

and the musical score is cosmic and moving

If you think the movie starts out slow





just wait

It's the final act that makes the build up oh-so-worth it

If you haven't seen it

you must

I'm not very good at writing reviews





I tend to go all over the place

So I won't try and tell you everything about this movie

Find out for yourself

But if you have seen it (which you likely have)

watch it again

Notice how it makes you feel

how it transforms the idea of fear into wonder and hope

how it makes you look at the sky at night

Close Encounters is Spielberg at his best

I hope he does another one like this in the future

This kind of movie is rare
