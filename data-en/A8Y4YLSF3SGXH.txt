When this movie was first released

I was barely at walking age

I remember seeing it on TV a few times over the years

I really liked it a lot

I finally decided to buy it and im glad I did

Yes

the film looks a bit aged

but for being almost 30 years old

it still holds up for the most part

I highly recommend that you buy the two disc special edition instead of the single disc edition

A lot of really good bonus material in the two disc edition
