THE YOUNG AT HEART is one of my favorite films

no kidding

It's the sweet & charming tale of an apparently rich

elderly woman who meets a family of grifters who put the moves on her

and eventually move into her mansion

The grifters are really nice at heart

but they're just sort of weak & the father & son have an adhorrence of work--any kind of work

Yes it' all very sentimental & melodramatic

but the film has some interesting things to say about human nature & says with a great deal of comedic skill

I'm glad they didn't colorize the film because it is perfect just the way it is

There is a scene where the father & son see that they have no choice but to go out and find gainful employment

The mood is sombre & they act like they are going to their execution

Great for rental

purchasing

archiving

NOTE: Although many of these 30-40's films have colorized jackets

the movie may actually be available only in black & white

Read the product description carefully

Personally I really like B&W; films

A little trick I learned in the event the film has been

in fact

colorized--is to disable (or lower to 0) the color

tint & hue options on your set and you've got your B&W; movie & you can adjust the contrast accordingly
