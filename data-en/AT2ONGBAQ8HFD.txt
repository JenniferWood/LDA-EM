This is one of those movies that never fails to make you laugh and to shed a tear

It's all about the relationship between the Former First Lady Tess

played by Shirley MacLaine

and her secret service contingent

lead by Doug Chesny played by Nick Cage

She's fiesty

determined and cantankerous when she doesn't get her way and what she wants is to keep her Special Agent in Charge Doug at her side while he yearns to get back into the thick of being a Secret Service agent instead of living the life of a retiree

The secret behind her desire to hold onto Doug is *spoiler alert* the fact that he so loved Tess' late husband who died while still serving as President

He was loyal

protected his secrets and served him steadfastly and while Tess' own children were divorced from the normal family dynamic

she sees Doug as a surrogate son whom her late husband trusted implicitly and Doug is her last link to her late husband

who she still loves despite the fact that he died while entertaining another woman

The movie focuses on their relationship and the depth of care that they develop for each other while bad behavior and some dangerous twists occur

most of them leading to outright guffaws of laughter and some tears

It's one of those sweet movies that has so much going for it that if we don't have it out during our family gatherings for the holidays

people ask for it to be brought out and played

And

while there are a few moments of blue language

it's a great movie for kids as well as grown ups

an all around family classic
