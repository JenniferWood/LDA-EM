I've seen this movie many times and always enjoy it

After watching the Extra Features that are on the Blu-Ray I'm glad someone had the wisdom to delete the scenes that were deleted and re-focus the relationship between Dotty and Jimmy

The scenes that were deleted would have ruined the movie for me had they not been deleted
