\"Joseph\" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced

It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way

This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph

The production is superb and settings are excellent

Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts

Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well

Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph

Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers

The supporting cast was fantastic

Although I have read the story of Joseph

this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it

I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done

The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion

However

this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions

Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it
