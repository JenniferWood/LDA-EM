This movie

JOSEPH

is in-depth and interesting

They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph

but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes

so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie

They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar

so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture

though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role

But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not

I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films

and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture

Also

to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star

they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave

They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph

I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph

I never thought of that aspect

and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph

but it makes sense

after seeing it in this movie

They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed

especially as a youngster

I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant

spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery

It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story

This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah

Joseph's brother

from Genesis 38

which surprised me

Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother

They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality

The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting

in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison

This is a fine movie to have on DVD

It is 3 hours long

so you might want to stretch it out over two nights

There is another DVD that I can recommend

starring Maritn Landau as Abraham

with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah

called IN THE BEGINNING

which is also very good

It

too

covers the story of Joseph in a faster

more condensed version

IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events

but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD

JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT

the cable TV channel

under the subheading \"The Bible Collection

\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well

Actually

TNT is just releasing the DVD versions

I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's

There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years

of these LUBE movies

Look for ESTHER

JEREMIAH

and SOLOMON

as well

These three come in a money-saving collection called THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET

which is well worth the price
