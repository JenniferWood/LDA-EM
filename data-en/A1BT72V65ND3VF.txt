I saw this movie years ago and recently re-watched it

Once again it had me chuckling



Nick Cage plays a SS man who has to guard an aging ex-first lady (MacLaine) though would rather be out in the feild where there is more action

The relationship between the two is priceless and Cage always plays repressed anger so well



Love the movie- just plain fun
