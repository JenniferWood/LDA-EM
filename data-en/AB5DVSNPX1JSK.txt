Close Encounters of the Third Kind was a revolutionary film for its time

which is why it is so highly appreciated by so many

Including moi

It not only wowed people with special effects

but a story line

For once

an alien film didn't include corny music and screaming women standing out in the streets

or little green men shooting lasers or what not

This film brought sci-fi films to a new degree

So often

we see sci-fi films inter-relate with horror films

this is no horror film

it's a true sci-fi film

The suspense does not come from terror

but from wonder and awe

I've read some reviews that state that you shouldn't show awe towards aliens that kidnap and brainwash people

From what I saw

there was no brainwashing

and the kidnapping was not as big a deal as you may think at first

Richard Dreyfuss gives a hell of a performance in this

He's an ordinary guy whose life gets turned around by these phenominal events

which are the sighting of UFOs

Other ordinary people are effected as well

This is the power of the film

The heroes aren't these Indiana Jones or super experts who know \"everything\" about aliens

They are people

like you and I

who have a drastic change of viewpoint

Other reviewers complain about Dreyfuss's character because he becomes obsessed with this phenom

Well

excuse me

but if your entire world as you knew it was suddenly changed because you realized that there were higher forms of intelligent life out there

you might become obsessed yourself in figuring out the truth

It's realistic and human to be curious

I think this movie was very realistic and avoided the corny

unrealism of other sci-fi junk

The negatives of this movie is:1

Not enough Alien parts

meaning there needed to be more encounters with Dreyfuss or with other people

There were only two

not counting the end

This isn't enough

at least I felt

to get a good grip that this film is about Aliens and not government cover up

Because the first third is about the Aliens impacting people's lives

while the other two thirds is government conspiracy or the recreation of Devil's Peak either through dirt

mashed potatos

or drawings

2

As a result

to not enough encounters with the Aliens

the film can be quite boring at certain points

Now when I say encounters

I don't necessarily mean having more scenes where they fly around and buzz people with their space ships

Not at all

I mean more alien phenoms

like the ship in the middle of the desert or the lost air planes now suddenly found

These were great

there needed to be more of them

3

The ending

I don't know

it was awe inspiring but at the same time real boring

There needed to be a climax

and I think Spielberg felt that the aliens showing themselves would be it

I'd rather they hadn't shown the aliens

that would've been more real

Think about it

making contact with an entirely different species

Not real

Plus

Dreyfuss just suddenly given the nod to travel with them

even though he's wanted by the government

I mean come on

not real

4

Because this film has some lengthy

boring scenes

it's more likely than not this won't be an addictive film

You may see it more than once but you'll probably allow a great deal of time to pass in between

because it's a film of wonder not a film of entertainment galore

As you can see

there are some flaws that keep this film from being totally realistic

But for the most part it is

and I liked it

I think you need to see this film

you will enjoy it for the first time at least

Seeing it again and again

I don't know about that

That's why it's four stars and not five

Grade: B
