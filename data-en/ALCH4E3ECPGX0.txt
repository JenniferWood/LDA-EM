This is actually the third edition of Close Encounters

and could be considered the director&#8217;s cut

For the special edition

Spielberg had to make some promises to Columbia about showing the &#8220;inside of the ship&#8221; before they would give him the money to &#8220;finish&#8221; a film he had to rush into the can because of the studio&#8217;s budgetary problems in 1977 (watch the included documentary)

The result is breath taking

It will ruin you for all the





expensive film currently washing through theatres in the U

S

(no names &#8211; I&#8217;m sure by now everyone has their favorite stinker for this year

even though it&#8217;s only June)

This was not a cheap movie

Many effects

including Spielberg&#8217;s trademark use of &#8220;cloud tank&#8221; skies were perfected for this film

Not everything worked the first or fourth time they tried it

Columbia ran low on money while Spielberg was polishing off the second edit

replete with footage added

I argue that he just did not want to stop touching his movie until he was forced to

My proof is that there are currently three versions of this film

two of which have additional footage that was added by Spielberg after BOTH 1st and second unit were wrapped up

This is not Spielberg&#8217;s magnum opus: I believe that is in the future

As a director he is growing and changing and building on all those glorious films he has given to the world

rushing towards a pinnacle that will change film forever

Not all of them worked

This one did

The result is what our parents used to experience in a dark theatre years ago when people&#8217;s lives changed based on what flickered before them on a silver screen

Magic

And for just shy of three hours

this magic will be yours again

in your homes

with your families

for as long as your VCR or DVD functions

A truly great artist understands that people want to dream

and be lifted into worlds away from those familiar

if only for a little while

Spielberg is a truly great artist

This was his third film
