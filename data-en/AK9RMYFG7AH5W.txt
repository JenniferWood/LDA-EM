This is a GREAT movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy

It is an older movie

so it actually has a real vocabulary

INSTEAD of a bunch of foul language

Anyone who grew up in the 50's

60's will find it especially endearing

Seeing all the old cars

the way people lived back then

etc





There are a few great lessons of life in this Movie
