This film is the best of the sequels from the first Godzilla series

There are touches of humor interspersed in the action

but it is not a silly movie by any means (unlike some of those that followed it)

I don't know what it is about Mothra

but he is just a great monster--it is hard to even call him a monster because he somehow manages to emote real emotions

I cannot help but root him on

even against Godzilla

To my eyes

the Mothra special effects are very well done

especially when he directly attacks Godzilla



Knowing that he (or she

) was using up what little strength he had in order to fend off the big lizard and protect his own egg made me really respect and empathize with him

When his strength was all gone and he came down to earth with one massive wing protectively covering his giant egg

I was actually quite touched

Of course

you have to love the twins from Mothra Island

They really help make this movie one of Godzilla's best

We don't know why they are so small

but we know their island has been all but decimated as a result of nuclear testing--the traditional anti-nuclear argument is made quite forcefully when our Japanese protagonists visit the island to ask for Mothra's help in defeating Godzilla

What I love most about the twins is their singing--I have no idea what they are saying

but their voices are beautiful

One of the great strengths of this film is the entire musical score

arguably the best of the series

Sure

the Mothra larvae aren't that impressive to look at

but they get the job done

This movie is somewhat unusual because there really aren't that many scenes of monster battles or wholesale destruction

Godzilla doesn't spend much time stomping around just for the sheer enjoyment of it

and he doesn't do anything as specific as picking up a trainload of people and tossing them aside

The obligatory tanks and airplanes attack

but they are as ineffective as usual against the big guy

When he squares off with Mothra

he has to stand in one place and fight the winged creature off; later on

the larvae cannot come up and duke it out with the big guy but instead must rely on their ability to spew silky cocoon-like fluid

These fights were definitely not conducted on Godzilla's own terms

This is a truly classic

must-see selection in the Godzilla video library

The storyline is relatively strong

the special effects are quite good

the music is excellent

and the monsters put on a pretty good show

If you want to see Godzilla in hand-to-hand combat with other big green guys

check out one of the later films; if you want to see how good a Godzilla movie can be when great care goes into the writing and production efforts

Godzilla vs

Mothra is your movie
