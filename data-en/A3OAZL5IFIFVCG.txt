Aside from the central characters being 'adults' whisk back in time to 'the days of their youth'

I found this movie immersive and really engaging

It's a really great movie with a well thought out premise

and the 'elderly' central figures within

pull this off excellently

I actually forgot the stars were their current ages at the time they were cast for this

I give it 5 stars because it transcended to conventional to become a classic





if not only in my own mind(

)





It's fun

smart

and even IF you weren't born in the 1950's (or '60's' or '70's' or '80's or '90's





or so) this tale should strike a resonating 'chord' with just about everyone with a pulse

I liked it

I bought it

and I highly recommend adding this to your collection





and at 'under $5'

what can I say

It 'time traveled me' back to a time of the here and now to a price and blu-ray format that was a great investment for any time frame
