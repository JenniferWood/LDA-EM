This cheerful

funny comedy absolutely delighted me the first time I saw it

and I bought it soon afterwards

Based on the true story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League

which was formed during World War II when many of the male baseball players went off to war

it features great performances from the entire cast

including Tom Hanks

Geena Davis

Madonna

Lori Petty

and Garry Marshall

Penny Marshall's smooth direction and the screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (&quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;) make the story come alive before your eyes

With every victory

you cheer; every heartbreak

you feel like sharing in the tears

An absolute delight

especially for anyone who loves baseball
