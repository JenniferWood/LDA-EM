93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale

An excellent and original adaption

An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic

Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character

Benedict Slade

He does a great job as a hardnosed old man

and he does look convincing in aged make up

The story takes place in New England America

during the Great Depression

-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways

Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman

On Christmas Eve he and his employee

Thatcher

go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his

Slade says

When carolers show up at Slade's door

he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did

he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future

-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes

\"Hell isn't what you think it is

devils with pitchforks

fire and brimstone

\"\"Thank God

\" Slade responds

\"It's worse

\" Latham says

A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business

Latham

You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil

\"\"Evil isn't just what you do

\" Latham replies

\"It's also what you DON'T do

\"A wonderful sentiment

The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity

history

a man's life

and a man's effect on the people and world around him

-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption

the Ghosts of Christmas Past

Present

and Future are played by Slade's customers

the very people he just repossessed items from

Slade actually believes them to be the same people

having broken into his warehouse

Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers

The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future

even when it's unplugged

-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man

he is still a bit of a grump

As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress

He is more generous

more concerned with the welfare of others

including the town

the unemployed

his employee Thatcher and his sick son

the orphanage where he once stayed at

but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet

-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently

\"Did you read that book

Mister Slade

\" a bookseller asks

after Slade has reformed

\"The ghost of hell

The ghosts of Christmases Past

Present and Future

Complete and utter





what was the word he used

\"\"Humbug

\"
