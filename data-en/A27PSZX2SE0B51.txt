Remember the episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; where Homer pulls a can from the cupboard labeled 'Nuts and Gum: Together at Last'

takes a handful and starts chomping

&quot;I'm a white male

age 18 to 49

&quot; he says

&quot;Everyone listens to me -- no matter how dumb my suggestions are

&quot; Well

that's the light-hearted and ironic way of wielding a satirical sword around white man's burden

For the other

more vitriolic way

look no further than Neil LaBute's fascinating study

&quot;In the Company of Men&quot;

LaBute creates a white-shirted world of angry white men

&quot;unfairly&quot; jettisoned to open the new corporate offices in another city

Marketing exec Chad is angry that his 'Nuts and Gum' power is waning

and concocts a scheme to salvage some shred of dignity before being dragged out to pasture

He convinces his boss and friend

a pushover named Howard

to doubleteam wine-and-dine a hopeless and handicapped woman

only to drop her like a sack of potatoes once their six-week sojourn is up

Her pain will become their entertainment

A more misogynistic setup you'll never find

Matt Malloy as Howard begins as a fine middle-management flunky

This is his first project in power

and Malloy portrays his anxiety and uneasiness quite effectively in the beginning

Unfortunately

his work becomes embarrassing later on

when he has to shed the corporate veneer and wear his heart on his sleeve

The character is written well (blandly sincere in the best sense) but Malloy isn't up to the challenge of the film's climax

Stacey Edwards as Christine is believable as a terminally shy office temp

Her deaf voice (which is skewered mercilessly by her antagonists) is authentic

and so is her vulnerability

There's a scene near the end where she is confronted by the horrors of her situation

and it's just heartbreaking

But neither of these two leading performances registers on the memory

due to Aaron Eckhart's ball-of-fire turn as Chad

Chad is as toxic as a Troma film

He has balls the size of watermelons

And he's as fake as the Hitler diaries

Eckhart imbues these qualities (for lack of a better world) with intense glee

Witness him finally pull the curtain back to skewer Christine

You can almost see the venom dripping from his lips as he metaphorically tears her flesh apart

It's a riveting

charismatic

and important performance that dominates the whole movie

LaBute wears two hats here

The first

as screenwriter

is nearly note-perfect

He does wonders with the banality of office dialogue

sprinkling it with nonsense titles and terms and then popping in a crude joke to lighten things up

He's at his best when writing for Chad

whether it's venting speeches or insincere pillow talk

This is no holds barred

straight from the id

guy talk

And even though it appears exaggerated

LaBute gets the tone just right

The other hat he wears is that of director

And even though he's hampered by a miniscule budget

he manages at least one stylistic choice that works beautifully

Most of the movie is composed of long takes

with the camera positioned a good distance from the action

rarely moving

This gives the film a voyeuristic

almost documentary feel

When the actors are on

and the scene is working

the audience feels privy to a world they wouldn't otherwise be invited into

It's very effective given the subject matter

This is a fascinating snapshot of late-'90's disaffection

LaBute never panders to optimism

right down to the shocking twist ending

He gives you a gloriously even (and most of the time vicariously fun) take on a subject many will find uncomfortable

but most should be confronted with
