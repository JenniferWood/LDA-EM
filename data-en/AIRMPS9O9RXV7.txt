it always amazes me how people can rate the DVD months before its release

Well done to you all

i am in your service

All i can say is i am a huge fan of this movie

it brings together everything that makes Steven Spielburg a GOD

From a beautiful and natural 'everyday guy' Drafus

to dazling special effects

charmingly mixed with a solution of classic John williams (music for Jaws

star wars etc

) If the DVD is loaded with features it will be spectacular if it isnt it will remain simply a masterpiece of cinema history

Buy it

especially if you are the one person alive yet to see it

I hope this is the start to a rush of spielburg releases

Bring on Indiana jones

schinderlers list and about 20 other classics

Any sign of the Goonies
