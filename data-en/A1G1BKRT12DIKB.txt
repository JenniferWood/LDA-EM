A very plotless movie about a ww2 american soldier and japanese soldier on a deserted island----sort of thing THE TWILIGHT ZONE did a lot better in 30 minutes; this plotless movie is almost two hours

Even a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode in which Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery are opposing survivers of ww3 had more dialogue and plot than this movie

From director John Boorman---his DELIVERANCE is a million time better

though it's as much a jungle movie as this thing
