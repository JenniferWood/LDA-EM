Everyone alive has seen this movie by now

so there's no point in writing yet another review

I just wanted to say something negative about Richard Dreyfus

who in my opinion is possibly one of the worst actors - ever

And I mean that

He's untalented

irritating and just terrible in every role

I can't think of one role he's done where that whiny

abrasive

neurotic personality doesn't diminish the movie

And I can't think of any movie he's been in that virtually ANY other actor could not have done better

That includes Close Encounters

the Goodbye Girl

What About Bob

etc

Honestly

I try to avoid his films at all costs - but a couple of these had good stories and other good actors

This movie is one of those

So I was compelled to watch it

But it makes you wish at several points in the movie that they would have just killed off his character and gone in a different direction

It was a mistake to try and build a great movie around him

and obviously

I'm still unhappy that they tried

I don't know who's life he saved

or who he loaned money to - but somebody clearly was forced to put him in

He

by himself

brought this movie down two full stars

Still a good one

but it could have been really superb without him

Well

there it is

Richard

I hope you run across this review someday and understand how much I really despise the fact that you \"made it\" to the big screen when so many other deserving

talented actors did not

You sir are living proof that there is no justice in this world

Enjoy my review
