I thought that this film was really good

i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women

I really liked the end

it was so good

best part in the entire movie and worth buying just for that

This movie made the story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit

it makes you realize just how hard it was for him

that his own family would betray him

And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true

His brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved Joseph more than them

Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God

He was sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out

but because God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family
