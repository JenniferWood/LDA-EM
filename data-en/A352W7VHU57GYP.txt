This is a love story superimposed on top of an action crime drama

Very smart marketing but you don't get the best of either that way

Overall though it succeeds

Far less flaws than most big budget blockbusters but here they are anyway:1

The dynamics between Sutherland's and Gallo's characters in the first quarter of the film are inconsistent

Sutherland is a totally ruthless

remorseless killer who commits crime with the relentless one way commitment of a barracuda on the attack

But his compatriots are opposed to killing and he endures way more whining

arguing and complaining than a softer character would have put up with

There was a point early in the film when it would have been entirely logical and self consistent for his character to just blow his partners away (I TOLD you to shut up

whatchu gonna do now

) and proceed solo

2

Much the dialogue in the beginning is weak

It improves later on

3

The the overbearing

overloud Gen Y point-something-or-other soundtrack

The &quot;Hey we're just havin' a groovy time rockin' down the highway&quot; vibe it imparts is out of place

4

The romantic subplot

It might have been possible to take the subplot alone and turn it into a great love story but here it only gets in the way

Along with it comes the melodramatic bittersweet ending which epitomizes bathos (sic)

Sutherland is the heavy even though Vincent Gallo has the lead role

Gallo is sort of heavy #2

He's a victim of circumstances

in a way

swept up in a storm of events that starts with a drug heist gone bad

He's also the male half of the love story; Kim Dickens does a great job as the female half

Mykelti Williamson is superb as Marcus

the undercover DEA agent

My only prior exposure to Kevin Pollak was as a hardened criminal in

The Usual Suspects

and it's disorienting to see him here as a conflicted hostage but he pulls it off

Grace Phillips is excellent as his girlfriend

Three and a half stars

almost four

Very solid acting

excellent pacing and action

Ya oughta check it
