I usually do not review movies on Amazon unless it is a movie that is profound and left me pondering

This is one such movie

For those of you guys who are interested in watching/buying it

may I suggest that you do not watch it on a romantic &quot;movie night out

&quot; This show will evaporate any romantic mood you may have

Trust me on this one

It can turn your girlfriend into a misandrist

For the ladies

if you want to watch it

please prepare yourself and keep an open mind





As most reviewers already said

this is one heck of a disturbing movie

The premise is that 2 men (Chad and Howard) are out to &quot;play&quot; a woman

make her fall in love

and then rip her heart out

figuratively speaking

Since it isn't a Hollywood stylized movie

don't expect a happy and cozy ending

Some of the scenes are quite provocative yet realistic

I can see it happening in ordinary day-to-day living

You're more likely to see a scene in this movie than a scene in than cutesy &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding

&quot; Because this is a dark comedy

most people will not be comfortable with it

It isn't something we expect to see

since it conflicts a lot with our own moral ethics

The technicalities of the movie is quite poor

and I'm going to have to deduct 1 star for that

Video and sound quality is really awful

poorer than the average Indie movie

There are very few sound effects

hardly any musical

and the voice recordings have static

Video quality is grainy and low in saturation

it really look like playing from a VCR (even though I'm watching the DVD version)

Here's more extraneous info: my take on the moral of this story is that if you are a guy

don't be a jerk like Chad

But also

don't be a wishy-washy weakling like Howard; stand your ground

and don't get pushed around

Both characters have their strengths and weakness

But I think both end up being the losers

even though the movie victimizes Howard more since he is the &quot;nice guy

&quot; I thought Howard would have more of a backbone

but I am disappointed that in the end

he never really stood up for himself
