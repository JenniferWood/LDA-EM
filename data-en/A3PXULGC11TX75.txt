Always great to see the scene shots and filming locations done by Spielberg

This movie embodies his talents in the likes of E

T

and 1941

Great acting and extra scene shots not shown in the original film release

Richard Dreyfuss never disappoints

Great supporting cast of actors

Now if only we can all use our smart phones these days with cameras for more opportunities to collect UFO photos









hey wait

why doesn't that actually happen
