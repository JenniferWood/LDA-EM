For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979





in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade

Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast

Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie

even under layers and layers of make-up

The scene is shifted from 1840's London to Depression-era New England

as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans

Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past

Present

and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story

the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways

and he becomes a caring

generous

amiable man

In a bit of ridiculousness

the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains

dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music

Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead

and is comical by todays standards

Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines

Still





Dickens is a classic





why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me

This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C

Scott versions
