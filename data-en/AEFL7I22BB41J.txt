A masterpiece

This film dwells with the formation of &quot;CHARACTER&quot; (with capital letters)

A son tries to escape what seems to be a fateful destiny

only to find out that his quest leads him to a final confrontation with his father

formally absent

but very present in his life

The undertones of the wretched relationship between father and son are presented with superb craftmanship by Jan Decleir

The depiction of the oppressive society and conventions that have to be confronted by the young man

in order to pursue his independence and liberation

is very powerful and stirring

If you are into something deeper than common Hollywood standards

this is a picture you will like and view more than once
