I rented this movie the other nite and can't stop watching it

It's about a group of church ladies who try to get gambling out of their town the fact that they have no clue what they are doing makes it hilarious

A couple of the funniest parts are when Barbara Harris is in the grocery store buying tons of cheerios and pretending not watch the crooks; another very funny part is at the end and they are in \"demo deby\" and the one lady breaks her nails

A good family movie worth watching
