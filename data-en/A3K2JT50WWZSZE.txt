One of my favorite movies

A real classic with Shirley MacLaine

She doesn't miss a beat

Great performances and excellent story line

Saw this movie at the theatres

knew I wanted to purchase it

Replaced my VHS with the DVD so I could keep it in my library for years to come

Shirley is her charming self and adds sophisticated humor
