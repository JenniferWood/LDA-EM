Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone

Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery

he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest

most powerful leader in Egypt

When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother

it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth

It's a lesson we can all take to heart
