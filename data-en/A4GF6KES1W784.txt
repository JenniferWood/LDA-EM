Excess Baggage remains to be one of the sloppiest movies I have ever seen

The characters feel incomplete; their dialogue sparse and meaningless

making it look like it was rushed into production before they really had time to develop a script and a real purpose for it

This movie failed to give a message

touch any emotional nerves

or be entertaining in any shape or fasion
