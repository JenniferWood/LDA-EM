I know this was released back in November of 2007 but Amazon ask me to review it

Finally

the 1977 uncut version of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" has been release on DVD

The first release on DVD still had three scenes missing from the 1977 version that I saw on the theaters

I did miss seeing the man with his family commenting on how far behind the aliens was in technology when it came to our highway systems

I also miss Ray wife (Teri Carr) complaining that she was not going to get a job and Ray looking at the pillow and seeing the mountain shape in it

The third scene was included with the outtakes

It was the scene with Ray walking into the Electric Power Plant (his job) and talking to his co-workers

The first two scenes were not in the outtakes so the movie was missing something

These two scenes were less than a minute each but they really stood out in the film

I had to wait 30 years for this movie to be release the way I originally saw it in the theater in 1977

If you enjoy the 1980 re-release version of this film it is also in this package and so is the release 1997 DVD copy

If you get it now it cost a lot less than it did in November of 2007 so

if you enjoyed the original versions of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" take advantage of this offer
