I saw this film when I was in elementary school

Now I am old enough to have serious issues with it

My biggest problem is how the filmmakers made it a point that Joe Clark blamed the teachers for everything wrong at that school

Is it their fault that the school district didn't do all it could to help the school

Is it there fault that the principals hadn't done all they could in the past

Is it their fault the kids swung in trees and had no discipline

NO

There was too much fingerpointing at the teachers and not enough at the parents

This is not how the real Eastside was

No one in their right mind would send their kids to a school if it was this bad

No school district would put up with it

The film just made a mockery of the education system by putting the blame on teachers and it wasn't fair

They made Joe Clark seem like some superman who helped the school on his own

The film made him into a hero as if he could walk on water

This film is not worth watching if you want the facts

I found the film entertaining but the message was fabricated

My three stars are for the actors

Morgan Freeman is terrific ( I love him ) but the film has a lot of flaws and disrespect for teachers

Enough said
