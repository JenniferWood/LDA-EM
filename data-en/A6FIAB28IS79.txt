Admittedly

an engaging

enchanting film

25 years later the performance of French film director Francois Truffaut as a foreign scientist

Richard Dreyfuss's obsession with mashed potatoes

and the sonic exploration of the octave and its overtones remain nestled in the viewer's subconscious

if not conscious

memory

But in retrospect this film followed an era in which an idealistic generation

once devoted to social change and the immortalization of its own youth culture

had to settle for the latter of the two possibilities

The &quot;story&quot; represents not just an escape from the banality of middle-class values but from responsibilities

conflicts

risky human relationships

and life itself

Another capitalistic commodity pretending to renounce a way of life it in fact promotes and is inextricably bound to

&quot;Close Encounters&quot; is the first of many blockbuster &quot;Third Kind&quot; epics to achieve success on the big screen

Play it with a good sound system
