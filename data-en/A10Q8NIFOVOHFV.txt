A giant egg floats into Japanese waters after a hurricane

Twin miniature fairies plead for its return to Mothra Island

In a Shakespearean twist of fate

Godzilla attacks and the Japanese enlist Mothra's help

Godzilla's rampages are fine

building toppling fun

The military fights back and the battle rages

As juvenile sci-fi epics go

this one is worth the price

The production values are better than usual

Chuckle-headed humor asserts itself

but plenty of Godzilla screen time keeps the action moving

The Mothra song

as vocalized by the twin fairies

is enshrined in fantasy film folklore

Watching the giant egg hatch is exciting

and recalls a similar scene in \"Rodan

\" Lightening flashes and thunder roars as cracks shoot across the egg's surface

The movie falters somewhat after two gigantic baby caterpillars take over for the first Mothra

Godzilla

who shrugged off rockets

bombs

and super-charged electrocution

has trouble with a rough-hewn silk shroud

Go figure

The Peanuts of the first Mothra flick portray the twin fairy girls

With all of the tiny women's mystery

one still lingers over their little faux-fur hats

The script doesn't explain the headgear

The special effects are unsophisticated by modern standards

The monsters are more lovable than today's ice-cold

computer-generated eye-candy

The Harry Potter generation can suit themselves

The venerable I

Honda directed this classic TOHO production

Saturday matinees and popcorn forever

;-)
