This is a great movie starring Geena Davis and Tom Hanks

It is about women in baseball during WWII

The acting is superb but you know what is going to happen through the whole movie meaning it is predictable

This movie was released in 1992 and grossed 109 million dollars

The DVD is disappointing because it doesn't have many extras and doesn't include the Madonna video &quot;This Use To Be My Playground&quot;

If you like this movie buy It and if you like Tom Hanks movies try Big(1988)
