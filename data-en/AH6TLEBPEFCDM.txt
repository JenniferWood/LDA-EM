This is one of the many Les Miserables movies that have been made

For those of you that don't like musicals

this rendention is for you

Liam Neeson

Geoffrey Rush

Uma Thurman and Claire Danes make this movie into the authentic true story that it is

It has a few rough scenes

but these had to be there to make the story true to form as Victor Hugo wrote about the times around the French Revolution

It is full of every emotion with defiance

romance

love

harshness

pitty

laughter and sadness

Liam is so wonderful to watch as the lead player

Great Movie
