Its a shame when action actors like Van Damme and Seagal get older that stunt doubles are more required to take up the slack of quicker punches and moves

As for this one though





its awesome and I saw more of his own moves

It has a lot of action throughout and a good story to back it up

Not to mention a good supporting actress at his side

This is probably Van Dammes last great one before the newer

and not so great ones were made later going straight to DTV

Now I have to say that &#34;In Hell&#34; was good too

I will review that next
