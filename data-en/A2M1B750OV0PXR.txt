I am a fan of action movies

but I've found some of Van Damme's previous flicks (most notably

Knock Off)

to be below average

After seeing this movie on TV

however

I was quite impressed and ended up buying it

As with most action movies

this one features a hero (Van Damme) who has to kick some butt

aided by a beautiful girl (Natasha Henstridge)

The movie starts off with a pretty good car chase

followed by lots of scenes with guns firing and martial arts sequences

The plot isn't extensive -- Van Damme's character's twin brother is killed and he now assumes his twin's identity

only to be hounded by the Russian mafia and corrupt FBI agents

I've only seen the VHS version

so unfortunately I can't comment on the DVD sound and video quality

Nevertheless

this is a good standard action flick -- in my opinion

Van Damme's best movie (or at least it rivals Bloodsport)

and I recommend it for any action movie fan
