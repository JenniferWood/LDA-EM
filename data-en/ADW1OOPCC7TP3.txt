If you like Godzilla movies then you're already too far gone to save

I don't know why I like them

I know they're silly and stupid

but there's something nostalgic and amusing about them

Mothra was always the most fascinating monster for him to fight

A giant moth



Who thought that up

A giant radio-active lizard fights a giant benevolent moth island guardian and her two caterpillar babies

Awesome is the only word to be used here

\"Godzilla vs

Mothra\" is colorful and fun and features those two little cute twins who sing to awaken Mothra

If you are already gone and like Godzilla then this could never disappoint you

After the original \"Godzilla\" this one is my favorite
