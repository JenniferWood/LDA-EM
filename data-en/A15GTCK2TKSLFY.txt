Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie

This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America

Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time

But most people can

t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has &#34;sold&#34;

Soon &#34;ghosts&#34;- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past

present

and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his &#34;value system&#34;

Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man

Dramatic with poignant scenes

Held my attention throughout
