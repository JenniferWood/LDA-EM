&quot;Guarding Tess&quot; opens with a dapper and cheery Doug Chesnick (Nicholas Cage) fleeing a three-year stint as Special Agent in Charge

United States Secret Service

during which he was responsible for guarding a recently-widowed former First Lady (Shirley MacLaine) in her mansion in rural Ohio

It's not only ditching the rusticity that puts a spring in Chesnick's step

but the opportunity to flee his employer

the authoritarian

aristocratic former First Lady

who has zeroed in on Chesnick while largely ignoring the rest of her staff

Her specialty

one quickly learns

is what the armed forces call the &quot;psy-op&quot; or

more simply

psychological warfare

It is part of Tess Carlisle's modus operandi to let Chesnick believe that he is finally free

and waste to his time reporting to Washington for a new assignment

Chesnick yearns to join the elite who guard the President

Instead

in D

C



Chesnick is told that Carlisle already has called the President to request that Chesnick be reassigned to another three-year &quot;tour&quot;

a tour of a truly martial sort

The current President was the late President Carlisle's Veep

which permits Tess to continue to brusquely address him as the underling he always was to her

Tess's wish is the new President's command

not least because it was her private say that got him the winning Carlisle ticket

In a fury

Chesnick is forced to return to Ohio

A kind of dance of death begins as Tess tries to break the spirit of the Special Agent in Charge

a title she cannot resist deconstructing

while Chesnick's fury mounts and he becomes all the more fanatical about adhering to the strictest (and most deadening) regulations of the Secret Service

It is quickly apparent that Tess Carlisle is vastly too clever and even (almost secretly) high-minded to have summoned Chesnick as a dimwitted mouse to bat around

yet she sincerely loathes his fastidiousness about seatments in cars and the tedium of being followed and observed 24-7

There is no denying the emotional S&amp;M the Tess and Chesnick mete out

but it is curiously bilateral

For reasons unexplained for much of the film

Tess cannot quite afford to have Chesnick quit (or actually quit

more precisely)

The power struggles that break out over her attempted use of agents as golf caddies and her recurring jailbreaks with a fearful chauffeur are as uproarious as they are petty

When the humiliated Chesnick is forced &quot;by regulation&quot; to alert the local sheriff

for example

that Tess Carlisle and her driver have lost their detail yet again

the sheriff puts the brokenly dignified agent on speakerphone

The deputies snigger en masse when the Sheriff intones mockingly: &quot;That Mrs

Carlisle sure is slippery





for a senior citizen and all

&quot; Formal as always

Chesnick does not permit himself so much as a note of sarcasm in his response

He communicates in rare tics and elaborate

furious pronunciations of basic instructions

but at no time does he debase his office

Sure enough

Chesnick quits over his inability

courtesy of the eccentric

tantrum-throwing Tess

to do his job &quot;properly&quot; (read: perfectly)

And

sure enough

Mrs

Carlisle has the new President on her speed dial

The calls put through from the President

a snarling and barking Texan

are episodes of comic sublimity

Each time

Chesnick

like virtually anyone other than the formidable Mrs

Carlisle

freezes with terror when told via a sudden phone call to &quot;hold for the President&quot;

The disembodied voice

emanating variously from the Oval Office and from Air Force One

is an uncanny

flawless mimicry of LBJ

Johnson's private threats

manipulations and vaunted coarseness are preserved in an inimitable Texan patois which melds obscenity

patriotism

blackmail and phoney good-ole-boy charm

The President is required

for example

to investigate Mrs

Carlisle's story that her agent &quot;ripped up some flowers&quot;

Chesnick speaks carefully about the distinction between fact and fiction: it was only a single flower

and he merely snapped off the bud

Though the President is whipped by the retired Mrs

Carlisle

he is fully alert to the lunacy of how his time is being wasted

The solution

Fix it

Agent Chesnick

&quot;or next time

you'll be guarding my dog

do you hear me son

&quot;When we learn at last of the origin of Tess Carlisle's fixation on Agent Chesnick

it is suitably poignant and ennobling

Rather than trying to break him

as it first appears

she is &quot;merely&quot; trying to get him to break the rules

We see Tess at her bullying worst and then her impossibly gracious best

in two very rare encounters with &quot;her&quot; public

No less a figure than Barbara Bush is said to have told MacLaine that the film was a perfectly accurate rendition of the relationship between agent and protectee

It is very revealing that such a remark should have come from the Grand Dame

Mrs

Bush

who is usually described as being as vicious and petty in private as she is marvellously patrician in public

The gun Chesnick is required to place on a table outside Mrs

Chesnick's room must go off

by the fifth act

according to the rules of drama

It does

and Chesnick's attention to detail is finally rewarded

Rather than &quot;some sick [sexual] thing&quot; going on

as the President earlier

hilariously

suggests

there is a courtly love which unfolds between Tess and her devoted agent which gives a final unity to this first comic

then poignant story
