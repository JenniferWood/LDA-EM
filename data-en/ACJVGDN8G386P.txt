This film

perhaps Spielberg's best among his more entertaining fair

is essentially about the war between wonder and fear

As human beings

we have an innate sensibility of fearing the unknown as a defense mechanism to combat those things which could be hostile and threaten our existence

be they at the individual level or at the societal level

History is filled with examples

usually of a tragic nature

in which human beings perpetrate against each other the worst kinds of inhumanity in the name of fear

be it religious

economic

or political

In large conflicts

human beings on each side rationalize that their adversaries are heinous monsters intentionally engaging in wrong-doing as an act of evil

Both sides

in other words

believe they are on the side \"right\" and vilify the other

In this circumstance

all behavior is dictated by fear rather than wonder

Countered to this inbred \"fear\" is also the capacity to engage in wonder

Human beings are also infinitely curious

and our curiosity stems from a child-like desire of wanting to know

to understand

and even to touch that which may be different

Fear and wonder are very incompatible bedfellows which reside in each of us

It is a constant challenge for the human race to decide which emotion will have its say in terms of behavior: wonder or fear

Fear is about anger

stereotypes

barriers

burning bridges

and making war

Wonder is about happiness

trust

letting go

being curious

and being vulnerable; it may be ultimately linked to those emotions associated with love

In the brilliant SF film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"

Spielberg and co

explore how these two opposing views clash in the midst of our \"third\" encounter with aliens from outer space

Early on

the story draws the divisions between those characters driven by fear as opposed to those who are willing to throw off fear in favor of wonder

Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and David Laughlin (Bob Balaban) are the two investigators who are led around the world by the series of inter-connected coincidences which lead them to believe something extra-terrestrial is going on

They are in the wonder department

And so is Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss)

a mid-west suburbanite who has an amazing \"encounter\"

as well as a little boy

Barry

in the same geographical region who is enthralled with the coming of the aliens

The US military

Roy's wife Ronnie Nearie (Teri Garr) and their family

and at first Jillian (Melinda Dillon)

the mother of the little boy

belong in the fear department

In a simultaneously poignant and revealing scene

when the aliens come to visit the little boy's house one night

his mother shuts all the doors

Then suddenly

Barry opens one of the doors revealing a splendor of light and magic spilling from beyond

Jillian runs to the door and quickly closes it

She will not forsake her child's safety for Barry's wonder and curiosity

Over and over

Barry displays a kind of innocent curiosity for the encounter while his mother can only react in fear

Lacking the fear of his mother

Barry eventually leaves the safety of his mother and joins the aliens

Ronnie Neary not only can't understand Roy's mood-swing from his encounter

she doesn't want to know anything about it

Something has been planted in Roy's mind

presumably by the aliens during his encounter

and he can't reconcile the image and its meaning

But Ronnie only fears what she doesn't understand

Roy doesn't do himself any favors when he turns his family upside down

but neither does his family attempt to find out what's troubling him

Fear becomes her dominating emotion while Roy is desperate to understand

The US military acts similarly to Ronnie as they want no outside interference in regards to the alien encounters

and continually deny the presence of these encounters

Ultimately

by film's end

we learn that all the fears of the characters have been unfounded

a delusion on their part

All consternation and trouble

which are usually required for a story to be compelling

were human-created and not of alien origin

The encounters were designed out of benevolence

not hostility

Only one character

that of Barry's mother

realizes her error and changes from one who is at first fearful to someone who is willing to embrace wonder

I believe fear rarely serves the human race

Certainly

fear has its place if a rhino is charging at you in the jungle

But if all human behavior is dictated by fear rather than a child-like wonder

we will miss out on some of the best of human experience

which I think may be Spielberg's point

The encounters and the close encounter of the third kind are only possible when human beings tear down the walls

throw down the barriers

and build bridges to the unknown

Certainly the unknown may be filled with snakes

But it could be filled with treasure also

The child risks falling by walking on two legs

Maybe adults should learn to do the same

Are we going to be a species who continually hides under the bed in the face of the unknown

or are we going to be the little boy who opens the door into the world of unknown wonders
