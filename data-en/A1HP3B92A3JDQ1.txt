Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona

but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie

His performance is quiet and subdued

not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor

I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser

Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other

Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved

and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents

Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business

I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well

I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies
