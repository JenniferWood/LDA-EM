One of the brightest sitcoms in TV history

with a stellar

never-miss ensemble cast

Unfortunately

it is also the most heavily edited

or as I prefer to call it

censored

ones

Get these tapes while they are still in print if you can swing it

you won't be sorry to have them

I don't look for the studio to pump money into an old show and ever release the full series uncut with original dialogue

minutes

and music on DVD or VHS

and too bad

It is probably the only thing I would ever pay $1000

00 for
