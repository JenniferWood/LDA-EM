Benicio Del Toro is a magnet in this movie

a strong acting force drawing you into that deep

hypnotic voice until you're head over heels in love

There are a handful of male characters that I could easily spend the rest of my life with

and Vincent Roche is one of them

He's a guy that will make you laugh

that you can talk to about anything

that you'd feel safe with

and that you'll lust after as well

Benicio is a leading actor who is too often cast in only supporting roles

Lead the way Benicio
