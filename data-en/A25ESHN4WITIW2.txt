VIDEO QUALITY:As with all Simitar Godzilla releases (minus &quot;Terror of Mecha-Godzilla&quot;)

&quot;Mothra vs

Godzilla&quot; is presented as a double sided disc with the choice of both widescreen and full screen editions

The full screen print is simply disgusting

not only loosing so much of the image (as you would expect)

the print if completely covered in scratches

hairs

cuts





burns

Colours are extremely faded
