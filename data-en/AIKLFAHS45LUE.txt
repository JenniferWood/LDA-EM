My second Classic Media DVD and one of marvelous quality

As with all of this collection's DVDs

the menu is exciting with music from the title theme and of course some nice special features Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski provide the commentary

I always enjoy thier commentaries because they are so into it: a G-fan's dream come true



This DVD is great but I wish Classic Media would release other less fortunate G-films

like \"King Kong vs

Godzilla\" and \"Destroy All Monsters\"

both having thier Japanese versions completely unavailable
