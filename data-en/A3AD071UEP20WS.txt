This is a must for readers and admirers of the diary of Anne Frank

In effect

the DVD completes the story--what was life like before the Frank family went into hiding

and what became of the family members after the family was discovered

All that is missing is the name and motive of the person who reported the family to the Gestapo

There are many photos of the participants

photos I'd never seen

There is also a too-brief tour of the Annex where Anne wrote her diary--and photos of the diary itself

Among those interviewed on camera are Otto Frank

Anne's father

Miep Gies who risked her life to help the people hiding in the Annex

girlhood friends of Anne

and a girl who saw Anne in her last days at Bergen Belsen concentration camp

But beware: this is all but certain to clear out the tear ducts

As any reader of the diary knows

this is a great tragedy

the story of a great loss
