What more can I add

As a teen

this was one of the first &#34;anticipation&#34; event movies

And i was not disappointed

Great movie

Oddly

I watched it about 5 years ago and thought it was a lot slower than I remembered

I though my teen daughter would find it boring

but years later she said how much she liked it

so I bought this blu-ray and we watched it again

Excellent film

Must see
