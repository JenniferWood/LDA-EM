i saw this film last night for the first time since childhood

and the movie itself was better than my very-positive memory of it

i watched the original 1977 version

and it was on a relatively large screen - at the red vic in san francisco - which i recommend highlyunlike more recent computer-generated \"eye-gasm\" style sci-fi flicks

CEOTTK begs us to fill in the gaps with the wonder of our imaginations - and then surprises/relieves us with each resolution and new question - such a ride

the end is a bit \"answery\" and it could be trimmed

for example

it might be more powerful and self-consistent to *not* see the actual creatures themselves

and instead witness them only through their amazing light-shadows and sonic-auras

but the film is light-years ahead of the show-every-detail computer over-generation that's become a staple of the sci-fi genrein combination with their judicious use

the special effects are clearly analog and make
