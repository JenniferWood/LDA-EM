This is an oldie but a goodie

It is probably the best movie on education in the US today

which is exactly why it will never make a real impact in terms of improving the quality of education delivered to children

especially inner city youth

The school system is corrupt to the core

the Unions could care less about the kids

they just want to get paid and to ensure that they get more and more money in their pension

which is already bloated and excessive

All the while

inner city youth are being passed on from grade to grade without ever learning

Public school teachers today are forbidden to give a student anything less than a C

A high proportion of High School seniors could not pass the 8th grade

if the standards were actually applied

The government is as effective in education as it will soon be in healthcare
