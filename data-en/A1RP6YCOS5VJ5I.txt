Out of all the movies from the Showa era of Godzilla

this is definitely the one that stands out the most after the original

The special effects are amazing for it's time

Watching the movie

I am amazed what they were able to pull off

such as the giant Mothra egg

Another cool thing about the movie is that it has a lot of actors who would later star in many Godzilla movies

so the choice of actors is also really good

My question always is

where did the twin girls from Infant Island get those fancy clothes when the island they come from is so primitive

They must have took them off of a doll

Overall

a classic movie that has aged a little

but still looks amazing after all of these years
