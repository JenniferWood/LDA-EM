This still rates as one of Spielberg's best films

Richard Dreyfuss is at his best here as a man being drawn toward the unknown

The special effects were top notch for their day and still hold up well

There are scenes in this movie

such as the scene in which Dreyfuss is in his car and the UFO lights up his car and the mailboxes are rattling

that just knock you on your a## in suspense

The film is directed beautifully and the story told dramatically

This film is a masterpiece in film history and always will be

Spielberg was hitting his stride at this point

Jaws

Raiders of the Lost Ark

Close Encounters

E

T

are all great films in their own right

Despite the fact that Spielberg still makes great films this was the time when he really soared
