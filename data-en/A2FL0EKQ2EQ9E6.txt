When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television

at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries

I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob

This film

though

is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph

It is truly astounding with a stellar cast

Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance

He tears the heart right out of you

No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails

This film is incredible and not to be missed

I always cry buckets of tears at the end

A true masterpiece in every way
