I am surprised that this movie is not more well known

I just happened to borrow a copy on VHS from my aunt

and the movie simply blew my mind

It shows another side of WW2 and really blasts apart the stereotypes of the Japanese soldier portrayed in American propaganda films and also the American soldier as many Japanese were led to believe

The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy

a Japanese soldier

Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another

They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand

Finally

they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together

They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island

The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch

the only complaint I have was the original ending

but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings

I was also pleasantly surprised that John Boorman directed this film

SEE THIS MOVIE
