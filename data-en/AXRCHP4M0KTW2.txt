This movie was realeased in 1977 and still packs the same magic charm as it did back then

The performances are top notch and oscar caliber

Dreyfuss won best actor for Goodbye Girl in the same year but should have won it in this movie because of his wonderful portrayal of a man wanting to know what is out there and get answers

he becomes possessed by what he saw one night and it splits his family apart

The special effects live up to today's standards

Speilberg does a wonderful job as director leading us up to the awesome climax with the mothership

watch it
