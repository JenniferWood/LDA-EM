It's a pity that Close Encounters was so badly overshadowed by \"Star Wars\" when it was released

because it IS an intriguing movie

Although a bit slow

the ending is exciting and the realism makes it worth watching

Just how WOULD aliens contact earthlings (and would anybody believe them

)

how would the government handle it

and what would happen









Spielberg gives us a definite hint of his greatness to come with this 70s classic

Worth adding to your collection

John William's score alone is worth buying
