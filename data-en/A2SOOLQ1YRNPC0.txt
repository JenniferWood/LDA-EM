One of the best movies either Shirely MacLaine or Nicholas Cage have ever done - and

like Tess herself

it has aged very nicely

This is a smart

funny

touching and very real story of a strong woman and the equally strong G-man responsible for her safety

Beautifully shot with incredibly real locations

verite lighting

great cast and brilliant direction

I cry every time at the end and you will

too
