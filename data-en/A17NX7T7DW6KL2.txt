This movie has the feel of a kind of corporate hell

It's not just the demonic Chad and his high testosterone levels

mysogeny

and \"Dangerous Liaisons\" attitude toward amusement at the office

Howard

the \"almost\" good guy with the decency to feel guilty about his participation in Chad's scheme to break a co-worker's heart

is so pathetic in his own way that he too seems right at home in this version of hell

Visually

the office is dim

artificially lit

windowless

occasionally cave-like

contributing to the general sense of petty

officey evil

Without giving away the end

I can only say that I loved the movie for its seeming indifference

its refusal to sympathesize

and the slightly stunned

\"wow\" kind of feeling that it left me with

It's an exploration of human nature along the lines of De Sade

and leaves you wondering about the strong and weak

and the relative value of virtue in corporate America
