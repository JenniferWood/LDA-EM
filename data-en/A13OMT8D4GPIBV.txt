This is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever

Steven Spielberg has given us many Sci-Fi movies and his first is still arguably his best

The \"Collector Edition\" of Close Encouters of the Third Kind presents us with the third version of the 1977 hit

This is an absolutely wonderful movie and DVD

It is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio

although this edition was not the one originally in theatres

On top of that

it is a wonderful Two Disc Edition

with features that everyone could love

It includes a feauturette

clocking in at 102 minutes

is a movie itself

It is entitled \"Watch the Skies\"

It also includes a second feauturette and a beavy of deleted scenes

11 in total

I suggest you pick this up

You could always wait for the Definitive Three Disc Edition

but if you're hard up on cash

I suggest this one

You will not be disappointed

It's an excellent film
