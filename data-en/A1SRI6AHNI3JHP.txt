This is probably the last of the great Godzilla films of the 60's unless you count Ghidrah the Three Headed Monster which wasn't too bad

After Godzilla vs Mothra the Godzilla suit and the films became increasingly silly

The original 1964 title was Godzilla vs The Thing

This film also contains some top notch special effects for the time
