The girls of the All American Girls Baseball League were an impressive bunch

The league

formed to fill the gap left by the canceling of the Major League season while the players were at war

was not the most popular idea at its inception





The story is good

Have no doubt

this movie is not a \"guy\" picture

but it is a great \"date movie

\"Gina Davis

Tom Hanks

and Lori Petty are all really amazing actors

Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell make great supporting cast members

Hey

it is a movie that Madonna didn't kill

The story is special and rather touching

There is good suspense in the movie

Generally

I am remarkably anti-suspense as I find it rather annoying

It is present in this film at times

but never long enough to become annoying





I have never been a huge baseball fan

But I must admit; I love baseball movies

There is something special about baseball that makes the movies great

Don't get me wrong

bad baseball movies exist

but for someone who is not a fan of the game

I can get behind movies about the game

\"A League of Their Own\" is no exception to this logic

There was a purity to the game back then
