Lots of black and white beauty and classy actors of the 30s and 40s here

I rarely laugh out loud at scenes in movies but this one has several that strike me as hilarious

The FACE Douglas Fairbanks

Jr

puts on when Marmy is describing to Miss Fortune how &#34;the children were born in India

somewhere in the Himalayas





&#34;; not only his surprise

but then his &#34;we're so very hungry&#34; bit

So funny

And the day he and his father watch men actually working

and ponder the whys and wherefores

Then the funeral dirge playing as father goes to his first real job





the sadness of father and son

as if dear dad were going off to the Front somewhere

This movie is rich

Full of dry humor and wonderfulness

I just love it and am so glad it's on dvd now
