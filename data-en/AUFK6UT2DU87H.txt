There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries

\"Joseph\" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts

and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here

I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers

Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry

and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth

\"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from

This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across

The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull

Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph

presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character

Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once

The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears

Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all

Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher

portraying a man of integrity and care

The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent

Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife

a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren

This scene is sexually charged

but I believe it is accurate with Scripture

The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things

nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation

Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph

I logically don't see how she could not have ben

He was

after all

seventeen when the attempted seduction took place

Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age

Besides

seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament

Anyway

I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off

Please give this wonderful film a chance

Happy viewing

and God bless you
