I have no great fascination for women's baseball today

and I have even less for some historical rehash

Add Geena Davis

Madonna

Lori Petty and Rosie O'Donnell

none of whom I find overly compelling and you have to pay me (bigtime) to get in front of the screen

So much for prejudging-- I enjoyed this sweet little film immensely

Penny Marshall's work has at times been uneven

but she hits a home run here

The movie is well paced

heart-warming

and at 127 minutes does not seem long at all

Only 3 males in sight

but they're really good ones

David Strathairn

Tom Hanks

and Garry Marshall-cast perfectly as the candy-bar magnate and team owner Walter Harvey

Beautiful tribute to real-life women pros bookends this storybook tale of women's comaraderie and triumph-a bright spot during the tragedy of wartime
