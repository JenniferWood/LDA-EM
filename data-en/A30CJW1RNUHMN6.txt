The Godzilla suit is of the finest ever created for any Godzilla flick

except King Kong vs

Godzilla 1962( my opinion)

This really is the the last great Godzilla movie ever made

After 1964 Godzilla had some shining moments in his later movies

but Godzilla movies from 1965 on were made with absolute sillieness and really no seriousness

The one exception was Godzilla vs

the Sea Monster 1966 this had some sillieness but had just enough seriousness to make it an adequate Godzilla movie

The 1970s were Godzillas whimp stage and his movies showed it

Sony Wonder does an excellent job with the film transfer and sound as it did with Godzilla vs

The Sea Monster and Godzilla vs

The Smog Monster (1971)

You almost swear Godzilla vs

Mothra was filmed a few years ago

(not 43 years ago)

the same could be said with the other two titles I mentioned

The one point I will bring out in this review is the genius of Ikira Ifakube

Ifakubes music score for Godzilla movies were used repeatedly in later Godzilla movies

but in Godzilla vs

Thing Ifakubes musical art is clearly heard in this film

Note when Mothra first arrives as Godzilla is ready to destroy the egg

Godzilla stares at Mothra ready to battle

the camera zooms closely on Godzillas face and all you hear is Ifakubes echoey like symbols in the background you really feel Godzillas fury

Story

music aside Amazingly and effective you feel the action and emotion in this film thanks to the directing of Inoshiro Honda and Akira Ifakubes brilliant music score

This movie does have a message to it about over land development and greedy humans of rich wealthy companies that don't care about nature or the enviroment they only care about development for profit

As Godzilla is trouncing Japan you see large scale factories being destroyed

portraying mankinds over development and pollution of the enviroment in the name of profit

Godzilla vs

Mothra shows how sometimes these greedy wealthy humans get more than they bargained for

The Mothra twins are cool and capture the 1960s with a flower power punch

I just wish the ending would have had Godzilla triumph

This movie really is a sci-fi epic I dont care what any fan or critics say

Godzilla vs

Mothra (or the Thing) is an incredible sci-fi adventure to be enjoyed by old and new G fans alike

The 1960s Toho Pictures golden age
