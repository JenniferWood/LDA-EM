The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1

Who is he

At first he's a Russian guy named Mikhail Suverov

then he's a French Policeman named Alain Moreau2

Which family member/friend must be avenged

When Suverov gets capped by the Russian mob

JCVDx23

Does he take his shirt off

In the most homoerotic of all places

a Russian bath-house

but he makes up for it later





4

Does he have sex with a C-List actress

JCVD has never attained a higher level than Natasha Henstridge

who looks absolutely stunning5

Is there a tournament

There is no tournament

But since there are two JCVDs

that wouldn't have been fair anyway

now would it

6

Is training needed for this tournament

No training needed7

Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament

No splits are done8

Does he punch someone in the balls

An early knee to the sack is delivered just for the checkmark9

Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks

Most definitely10

Is his enemy unbeatable

The Russian mob and the FBI are formidable

but far from unbeatable

11

Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance

He gets stabbed early on

but `tis a flesh wound

12

Does he win

It's like pouring a gallon of win into a shot glass

Opening with the greatest \"mobile fruit stand being pursued by the Russian mafia\"-chase scene in cinema history

JCVD teams up with director Ringo Lam for his first completely jaw-dropping JCVD experience - they later paired up for Replicant (another JCVDx2 venture) and Wake of Death (JCVD's best acting job)

From the very beginning

there is no doubt that awesome-factor 10 is about to ensue

The plot is typical of Van Damme movies and soap operas: A relative of JCVD gets killed (i

e

JCVD #1)

it turns out to be his twin brother

and it's up to JCVD to spin-kick and ball-punch his way through the Russian mafia for the answers

Without going to deep into it

this is tied for first place for all JCVD movies

A few reasons why:- Natasha Henstridge completely nude

multiple times- Claustrophobic car chase on narrow European streets- The only JCVD movie to feature strippers- Three of the best fight scenes in cinema history against a Russian behemoth (who looks like NFL-bust Brian Bosworth):a) best fist fight inside a fiery inferno in cinema historyb) best elevator knife fight in cinema historyc) best non-gay bathhouse fight by two guys in nothing but towels in cinema historyTo top it all off

I'm completely convinced the game Crazy Taxi (released in 1999) and Mel Gibson's character from Conspiracy Theory (1997) - conveniently one year after Maximum Risk - were completely plagiarized from an insane New York cab driver from this movie
