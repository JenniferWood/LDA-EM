I am not a Van Damme fan (don't care for his stony face and an overdose of martial arts)

I happened to catch this at a friend's place

But this movie has a surprisingly good plot

good pace

good action (the car chases could have been toned a notch)

good direction and a good performance by Van Damme

I wish he could have displayed some more emotion
