In this time travel spin a woman (Peggy Sue) at her high school reunion has a heart attack and while lingering between life and death

is transported back in time to her high school days

Peggy Sue knowing that her boyfriend Charlie will turn out rotten after she marries him

is determined not to repeat the same mistakes of the past

Peggy Sue tries to distance herself from Charlie and has an affair with a rebel/philospher student to try to change things

While doing this she learns about Charlie that she never knew and ends up falling in love with him all over again

I really enjoyed this film and it shows that Peggy Sue with all her future knowledge and superior attitude is still unable to change what originally occurred
