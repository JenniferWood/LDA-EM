First off

this movie is a classic

and should be seen

But it's not the best &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie I've seen; furthermore

this movie tends to drag its feet around

In short

this movie seems too long even though it's a short film

Most of the movie is dominated by Human Scenes

There are some humorous moments

but they're much more subtle

and far less in number than I hoped for

To be sure

the Human Scenes do engage the audience to certain point initially

but before the movie's conclusion

the Human Scenes feel as though they overstayed their welcome

Part of the reason for this is the lack of Monster Scenes - not to mention the fact that Godzilla doesn't appear until the 30th minute

And as far as Monster Battles go

there are four - but only two feature Monster-on-Monster action:1) Godzilla vs

the Military2) Godzilla vs

the Military3) Godzilla vs

Mothra4) Godzilla vs

Mothra's two offspringThat might seem like a lot

but it certainly didn't feel like it

The two military scenes are done well enough

but the last battle(s) wasn't as fun as I remembered it

And for me

I'm most enthralled by Kaiju movies when two or more monsters are going at it

The climactic fight certainly wasn't bad

but it certainly wasn't the best I've seen

All in all

I definitely recommend this movie

but I did feel that the Human Scenes dominated too much of the screen's focus

The scenes did flow logically enough - but for me

there wasn't an adequate number of good Monster Scenes

And I didn't much enjoy waiting 30 minutes to see Godzilla
