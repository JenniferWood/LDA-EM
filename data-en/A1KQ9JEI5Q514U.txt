This is the first documentary film I've seen where we meet Hello Silverberg

Hello

was Anne's first boyfriend before she went into hiding

It is a definite plus that he was interviewed for this piece

Not many people realize that Anne would be 79 years old as of June 2008

I do believe that she would have gone far in life had she lived

It's good that they interviewed so many for this documentary

It's sad that most of the Franks helpers could not be interviewed

The only surviving hero who helped the Franks is Miep Gies

I would also recommend the book on Victor Kugler which has been published recently

He was the Mr

Kraler Anne spoke of in her diary

He had a very interesting story to tell

Not much press is given to the fact that the 2 male office workers who helped hide the Franks also went to concentration camps

They did survive them but it was a horrific experience

I could spend hours watching a good documentary on Anne especially from the Biography channel

Anne represents all the people and all the children that have been the victims of hatred in this world

Because she was so gifted

I want to hear everything she said

A terrible tragedy the death of these 2 girls Anne and her sister Margot and all the other victims of Hitler's Regime of terror

So unnecessary and tragic
