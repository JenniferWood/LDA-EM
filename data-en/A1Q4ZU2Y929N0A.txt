Those who are looking for a comprehensive edition of Close Encounters need look no further than this wonderful 2 disc set

The first disc contains the newest Director's Cut of the movie

which includes the &quot;Mongolian ship&quot; scene -and- Neary's &quot;breakdown in the shower&quot; scene

Both of these add a dimension of reality to both the final discovery and Neary's mental state

The second disc is the real showpiece of this set

though

It contains all of the currently deleted scenes (including Roy's journey inside the UFO) and many other deleted scenes

as well as a making-of documentary

and theatrical trailers

Speilberg recently said that he could not make this movie today

and it's easy to see why in the psychological breakdown of Neary and what this does to his family (especialy his children)

I first saw this movie on a Cinemascope screen

and the DVD loses almost -nothing- in the transfer to my Projection TV

As a long time Speilberg fan

I highly recommend this disc set
