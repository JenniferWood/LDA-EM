When this movie was made Steven Spielberg knew exactly what he was doing when he had this movie made it is brilliant and very well done all of the special effects trick photography

as well as the storyline and everything else when everyone sees the UFO's and they are wondering what is going on and so on is also great so of course I say that is movie is very well done and it is definitely indeed a classic and if you watch this movie with your kids cause this is what I reccomend you do so that kids will get an idea of what this movie is about and you can explain it to them cause this movie has a mature rating but the adults can watch this movie with their kids and it will be enjoyed by all who watch

So this move is indeed a great spectacular movie that everyone will enjoy

I highly recommend you buy it and share it will all of the people that you love
