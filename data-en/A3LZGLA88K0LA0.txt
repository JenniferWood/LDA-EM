I wanted to really like A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN

A refreshingly uplifting tale of professional women baseball players

Penny Marshall kept the film moving and interesting

until





that copout of an ending

Rooting for the team the whole movie

and then kaboom







they don't win





I found Geena Davis and Lori Petty's characters to be the epitome of self-effacing

selfish whiny losers

Davis allows Petty to blame her for all the things that have gone wrong in her life; the whiny little sister who is always in the shadow of her more accomplished bigger sister wore thin

particularly since Petty was so self-centered in it

Then take Davis





she selfishly leaves the team at the World Series

then comes back in game 7 and expects to play

despite the fact that stand in Alice has played the first six games

And then

in the film's climactic moment

she \"drops\" the ball

all to allow her whiny sister a chance to be \"the star\" of the moment

And then afterwards

the two act like they are the best of friends in a maudlin huggy poo scene

I liked 3/4 of this movie

but the ending was a soporific attempt to pull \"a lifelike unpredictable ending

\" but was it fair to the team to allow this sibling rivalry to come out in favor of the whiny younger brat

Boo hiss
