Hong Kong action film director Ringo Lam

makes his American film debut in Maximum Risk (1996)

a gritty crime drama

that mostly stays in touch with reality

Action star Jean-Claude van Damme

has a dual role playing twin brothers

Alain Moreau and Mikhail Suverov

separated as children

Mikhail

a former member of the Russian underworld

is killed while trying to escape his criminal past in the south of France

Alain

a member of the French police

was unaware that he had a twin brother

and after his investigations reveal cover-ups

arson

and a connection to New York

he borrows his brother's passport

and heads over the Atlantic

to the Big Apple

Mistaken for his brother

Alain hooks up with Mikhail's girlfriend Alex (Natasha Henstridge)

and has the local Russian mafia stirred up

gunning for him

The FBI is also in the picture

as what everyone seems to be after

is a secret list in a safe deposit box

in a bank in Nice

France

Alain looks to make peace with the Russian mafia boss

but subordinate Ivan Dzasokhov (Zach Grenier) stages his assassination and a major purge

that almost costs Alain his life

The fight scene in a sauna

is probably the most unrealistic action sequence in the film

but it is still rather entertaining

Alain escapes

but is taken into FBI custody

and forced to take part in a plot to retrieve the secret list from the bank

The tone of Maximum Risk rarely wavers from being deadly serious

Jean-Claude plays it straight

and does not get too cute

The situations mostly stay within the limits of believability

resulting in a very tight

and credible film

The action sequences don't really go over the top

yet there is enough edginess to keep things from being too pedestrian

even by 2010 standards

Nicely paced

and bolstered by solid performances by van Damme and Henstridge

the film comes full circle

finishing with a violent flourish

in the south of France

Things must have clicked between Lam

and van Damme

as they would also team up in Replicant (2001)

and In Hell (2003)
