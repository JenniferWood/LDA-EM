This is a Classic Jim Henson story filled with great tunes

BEWARE - This is 2001 and it is really sad that the DVD transfer is so sub-standard

Especially since they state it has been &quot;Digitally Mastered Audio &amp; Video&quot;

Don't you believe it







This DVD may be exceptable on the small

standard TV but it's &quot;PICTURE QUALITY IS POOR IN THE HOME THEATRE HDTV ENVIRONMENT&quot;
