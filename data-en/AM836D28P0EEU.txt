As the studios release more and more back catalog material

dating back to before there was a PG-13 rating

it's tough to find suitable movies for the under 13's

Our 9-yr old daughter has enjoyed watching this with us at least twice

and I have no doubt that we'll watch it frequently enough to justify owning rather than renting

Where we've been somewhat burned by forgetting how old pre-PG-13 PG movies could be

this is not at all a question for us

Madonna plays a character who is adventurous

but her quips (such as a tight dress whose disomfort won't be an issue because she's &quot;not planning on wearing it that long&quot;) pass too quickly for them to register

But in no stretch is this just a movie for the pre-teens

The performance of Tom Hanks is absolutely terrific

and Geena Davis and Lori Petty make two very competitive sisters come to life

Jon Lovitz is hilarious as a scout

and Rosie O'Donnell is great as Madonna's comic foil

The writing is spot on in providing these actors turf to chew (who will ever forget &quot;there's no crying in baseball

&quot;

)

and the story is very pleasant

and a little inspirational even

The only part I don't like (and others may disagree) is the modern sections at the beginning and the end which set the stage for reminiscing about the league

To me (ok

I'm a guy

crush a beer can on my forehead) the time during those sections feels very slow

and the actors (different actors from the bulk of the movie) seem stiff

Thankfully

though

Hollywood has changed names while retaining some of the negative traits of the characters

Tom Hanks' character is based on that of Jimmy Foxx

a tremendous hitter who hit over 500 home runs

but whose career was cut short by alcohol

That aspect is here

and it's strong

although they have changed Foxx's name to Dugan
