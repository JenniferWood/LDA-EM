'Character' is a Dutch film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1998

The film begins as a young man

Jacob Katadreuffe

has been arrested on the suspicion of murdering Dreverhaven

a powerful and much feared bailiff in the city of Rotterdam

Katadreuffe is interrogated by the police and the recounting of his story forms a voice-over narration for the rest of the film

We flashback to the early 1920s as Katadreuffe relates that his mother

Joba

was Dreverhaven's housekeeper

They have a very brief affair but she decides to raise the child on her own since he is a cruel man who she cannot relate to

Nonetheless

Dreverhaven is persistent in trying to get Joba to change her mind

He sends an emissary laden with cash begging her to marry him but each time she rejects his entreaties

Finally Dreverhaven gives up and Joba is left to raise little Jacob on her own

Oddly

she has no fondness for the boy and throughout his childhood and adolescence she hardly says a word to him

'Character' has a few powerful scenes in its expository sequences

First we discover just how cruel a man Dreverhaven is

When he comes to evict a family who are behind on their rent

he finds an extremely sick woman inside the apartment and ends up dragging her out of bed and throws her out into the street

In another powerful scene

Katadreuffe is arrested with a group of other boys for stealing some bread and is almost raped by a pederast police officer inside a juvenile detention center

It should be noted that when Katadreuffe is detained

he tells the police that Dreverhaven is his father

But when questioned

Dreverhaven denies knowing the boy

Hence

at the outset

we wonder why the Dreverhaven rejects his son

Is he trying to get back at the mother who won't marry him

It's never really explained

Katadreuffe's 'call to adventure' begins when he finally becomes a young man

He's still living with his mother and decides that he must strike out on his own

He takes out a loan from a credit company and impulsively buys a cigar shop without checking the inventory

He soon discovers that the inventory

boxes of cigars

are filled with nothing but straw

One wonders why Katadreuffe didn't bother to inspect the inventory before purchasing the business

After this fiasco

Katadreuffe is forced to go back to live with his mother

Katadreuffe keeps pushing forward

He manages to land a job as an assistant to an attorney

Stroomkoning

at a law firm utilizing his English skills which he learned as a child studying an old encyclopedia

Soon after

Katadreuffe discovers that the credit company he borrowed the money from belongs to Dreverhaven

Katadreuffe is now in debt to his father who interestingly enough allows him to pay off his debts in installments

During the first go-round

he proves to his father that he's an honorable guy and pays off the debt as money is garnered from his pay check

Most of 'Act 2\" of 'Character' deals with Katadreuffe attempt to better his position within the law firm

He's attracted to Stroomkoning's secretary

Miss Te George

but due to his bitterness over the poor relationship with his father

he never works up the courage to hook up with her

The film's B story doesn't seem to go anywhere when Te George eventually leaves the firm and nothing comes of their relationship

Katadreuffe is eventually offered the position of office manager within the firm

Inexplicably

he asks Dreverhaven for another loan which he uses for tutoring to become a full-fledged attorney

The loan has one proviso: Dreverhaven can call it in at anytime

He does so just as Katadreuffe is about to take his exams

To Katadreuffe's horror

it's revealed that he failed to pay an earlier debt consisting of his 15 guilder collection of old books (including the encyclopedia)

Stroomkoning comes to his rescue

convincing the bankruptcy court that the debt was merely a gift

Meanwhile

Dreverhaven

the cruel

obsessed bailiff

has never given up hope that Joba will accept his proposition (why he still wants to marry her after all this time is never explained)

He visits her again after all these years and she turns him down on cue

This fuels his monstrous rage and he's off evicting as many poor tenants he can find

He's so obsessed that he serves a notice of eviction to a Communist who's in the middle of firefight with the police

In her old age

Joba becomes a little more talkative and chides Katadreuffe for not going after Lorna Te George

Joba soon dies and Dreverhaven has a soft spot in his heart and attends her funeral

The climax of 'Character' is unsatisfying

We expect Dreverhaven to do something shattering that leads Katadreuffe to confront him in the final scene

But it's nothing more than his graduation from law school and acceptance into the firm that propels him to the final confrontation with his father (Katadreuffe remarks that he \"knew all along\" that his father had been \"waiting\" for him)

Father and son are both bloodied as they duke it out at Dreverhaven's place of employment

Dreverhaven ends up dead but the police conclude that Dreverhaven committed suicide and let Katadreuffe go

'Character' is fairly absorbing until the Third Act Climax

The film is helped immensely by the brooding

noirish musical score

Although we never really find out what makes Dreverhaven tick

it's suggested that he was merely using 'tough love' as a means of building his son's character (Dreverhaven ends up ceding his entire estate to his son and signs his will \"Father\" to boot)

\"Character' is a melodrama with a nice look to it which will keep you engaged for most of its two hours

But the motivations of its 'characters' (especially Dreverhaven) are not always convincingly defined
