Just because it's an inspiring story does not make it a good film

This one is so overproduced and lacking in subtlety I almost turned it off in the first three minutes

but decided to give it a chance

Caught somewhere between a hip-hop video and an After School Special this film lacks almost any kind of deft story telling

Full of cliches

preachy rage

and bombastic dialogue it sometimes seems like it was really a student project with a big budget

If you don't want your classroom inspiration hammered over your head then rent a classy film like \"Stand and Deliver\" or \"To Sir

with Love\"
