I saw this movie on it's original release in 1977

To this day

it's my opinion that it's the best sci-fi film ever made

and not entirely 'fiction'

I remember that it's based on a collection of actual UFO reports

intending to put forth a plausible idea of how they may connect

Well they did an awesome job

This movie is special on so many levels: research

premise

script

casting

acting

cinematography

sound

editing

to name a few

This is a thinking-person's sci-fi movie that offers much feeling too

*AND it has a cameo appearance by 'Project Blue Book' scientific advisor and developer of the 'close encounter' classification system - Dr

J

Allen Hynek - look for him during the climax (with mustache

beard and pipe) moving forward in the crowd on the mountaintop

*** I HIGHLY Recommend it

*** Enjoy
