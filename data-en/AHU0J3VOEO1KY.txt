Being a hardcore fan of movies from Japan and China

Hell in the pacific is one of the few American arthouse movies I now owned and it is an absolutely fantastic piece of work

Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune is absolutely terrific in this movie

Their chemistry is as perfect as the story is tense and an absolutely hilarious esp during the scenes when they try to out do each other in their &quot;turf fight&quot;

I crack up everytime each one of them mess up their own dirty little wicked plan in the most humourous fashion

The cinematography is stunning and I really appreciate the alternate ending

I find the original ending really sucks big time

Still a solid 5 star for this movie

2 stars for both actors

1 star for the movie

1 star for the cinematography and 1 star for the alternate ending

There you go

a 5 star pure cinematic genius

I am very very happy with this DVD
