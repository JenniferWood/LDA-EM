Regardless of what past reviewer's have said this movie IS actually quite good

Alicia Silverstone is a good actress

She's more natural than almost any actress in Hollywood

This movie is basically a comedy with bits of romance and action mixed in

Its a little confusing the first time through but it gets better

There's alot of good one liners in this film as well and I don't think it got half as much credit as it should have

See it for yourself

I think you'll like it

Although things here and there don't add up to be a 5 star film but how many movies do
