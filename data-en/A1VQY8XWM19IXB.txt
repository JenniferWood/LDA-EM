CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of those films that define what the 70s were all about

moviewise

It is an exploration of humanity - what would it

truly

be like to meet an alien race from another world

What kind of people would be up to it

How would we communicate

And would they be hostile or friendly

Steven Spielberg's film has defied dating

Although the time and place are the same

the messages are universal and do not grow less with age

And Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary

American Everyman

hasn't been better before or since

in my opinion

Plus

the film boasts the legendary Francois Truffaut

The special effects

amazing for the day

continue to jawdrop

The sound and picture quality are flawless

especially the DTS track

which resonates with the voices of the otherworldly

The documentary

culled from the laserdisc version

is excellent

and even better than a commentary

It offers insight into the making of one of the most important science fiction films ever made

And there's a particularly hilarious story Steve Spielberg tells about an orangutang on roller skates that must be heard to be believed

This is a must own
