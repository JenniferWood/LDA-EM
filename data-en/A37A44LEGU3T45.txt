\"Joseph\" masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit

power

and passion of the Biblical narrative

The acting is of the highest quality

being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar

Despite some Hollywood license

\"Joseph\" remains true to the Biblical narrative

even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating)

It is an epic motion picture

lasting over 3 hours

but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor

\"Joseph\" does have its weaknesses

yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation

In fact

it is so good

I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites

It left me inspired

encouraged

and in awe of God's faithfulness

You will not be disappointed
