this film is about a group of seniors that reminisce their days playing on the women's baseball team in the 1940s

tom hanks plays their coach

this is the movie where rosie o'donnell and madonna also started up a friendship





i guess they found that they had some things in common

they made a great team together

also i love \"This Used To Be My Playground\"

it's a sure tearjerker and heartwarming

it's a perfect song for this movie





it makes me want to reminisce of my younger days

the lyrics are haunting and very sad

this is only one of the movies where madonna makes a decent

good actress
