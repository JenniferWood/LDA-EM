Mr

Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable

However

it isn't without a certain charm all its own

And to Henry's credit

and partly to my own blame

I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days

I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film

If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in

but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called \"must have Christmas movies\" then pass it up for another title
