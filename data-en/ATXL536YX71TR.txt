I visit CHARACTER

1997 Foreign film of the Year

ever so often and never tire of it

This Netherlands-made Mike Van Diem written and directed thriller based out of a 1938 novel entitled \"Katadreuffe und Dreverhoeven en Karakter\" ages like a fine wine and gets deeper and more character complex every time I view it

CHARACTER was released the same year as fellow epics TITANIC AND AMISTAD;and in the Foreign category

CHARACTER brought home another Oscar just as two years prior another Netherlands film

the amazing ANTONIA'S LINE

had been victorious

The fact that CHARACTER beat out BEYOND THE SILENCE from Germany and FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER from Brazil put this masterpiece in really fine company that year

As INSUFFICIENTLY stated IMO by Amazon's reviewer

CHARACTER is really a three way struggle between Father

Son and Mother in a battle of stubborn pride

obsession and control

All three main characters are all caught in this cat-and-mouse

dog-eat-dog psychological thriller set in 1923 Rotterdam

This screenplay/book is right out of the Charles Dickens mode full of bleak beginnings and endings

class struggles

acceptance

greed

lust

pride and vengeance that is particularly reminiscent of Dickens' NICHOLAS NICKLEBY IMO

Will good come out of all of this suffering





Dreverhoeven is the court bailiff who is as \"Scroogesque\" as one can be

He forecloses on everyone without blinking an eye

He has a housekeeper who never speaks to him

neither him to her;yet he \"fornicates\" (why we are never certain why either of them do this)with her one evening

Six weeks later

with child

Miss Katadreuffe resigns as housekeeper

She wants nothing from Dreverhoeven

He proposes marriage 13 times and she quietly refuses proudly and stubbornly each time

A son is born named Jacob Willem

He catches glimpses of this \"father\" here and there

but has only one constant thought of him planted in his brain by his hardened mother:\"We have need of nothing from him

\" As Jacob grows

the deafening silence that exists with his mother and now the involvement here and there with his father as a money lender increases Jacob's fierce and independent spirit to live free of both of them

This he continually finds impossible to do

The mother is austere and silent;the father is cruel and calculating;the son has terrible problems with both of them

yet is generally favored well by all of his coworkers

Things many times throughout this film come to a boil and the viewer is asked to consider the character motivation of each of the three principles

all the while realizing that the stress and strain is building Jacob into a strong and confidaent man

These are REAL and ALIVE and TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING characters for those who love this kind of a film

It is nail-biting and tense

and yet has an underlying sweetness AND sadness about it

The film is first rate in all departments from it's look

to it's editing to a wonderful soundtrack by Het Paleis Van Boem

14 time nominee

4 time winner Jan Declair (ANTONIA\"S LINE

DAENS etc

) is the bailiff/tyrant Deverhoeven; Freja Van Huet portrays Jacob Willem and Betty Schuurman is Miss Katadreuffe

All three are multiple European actor winners

This is a first rate acting job in a first rate film

The fact that Award winning director has done nothing since CHARACTER is a mystery to me

Imdb stops his resume with his triumph here

1997 was a great year for films

Watch CHARACTER and you will surely agree

EXTREMELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
