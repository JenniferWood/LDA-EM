This is the best presentation you'll probably ever see of this movie

If you read previous reviews then know that I agree with most of them

There's a lot of stuff here for fans of this movie

Yes there are some bad spots in the movie as far as video quality

but I don't know that there was anything else they could do to repair problems with the masters

One thing that I'd like to add to the other reviews is audio

I have the Panasonic DMP-BD30K bitstreaming the audio to a Denon AVR-3808ci receiver

The audio is fantastic

There's one scene when Roy is in the utility truck stopped at the train tracks checking his map

When the UFO shines the light on the truck and everything starts shaking

it felt the the UFO was over my house

I can't remember a movie that's ever worked the subwoofer so long or hard before

I do have a detraction from the release however

I think classic movies like this with all the bonus features ect

really need IME/PiP

People that are fans of the movie are going to be the majority of purchasers of this

and as such

are more likely to want IME stuff
