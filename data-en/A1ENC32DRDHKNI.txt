Who would have thought that a movie about women playing baseball during WWII would have been this good

But

it was

Penny Marshall does a very nice subtle job of trying to relay what it was like for the women who played baseball back during that time

I liked how Marshall made the movie from a retrospective view of Dottie Henson(Geena Davis)

It was nice to see the older ladies revitalized from playing baseball

and how it took them back to a happier time for themselves

The casting was first rate: Davis as Dottie Henson

Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan

Lori Petty as Kit

Madonna

Rosie O'Donnell

Megan Cavanagh

Bitty Schramm

David Straithairn(sp

)

Garry Marshall

and Tracy Reiner

I enjoyed the sibling tension between Dottie and Kit

It can be very difficult to be the younger sibling(Kit) when your older sibling(Dottie) is always outstanding

and tiresome

for the older sibling

when you are always blamed for existing by the younger sibling

Marshall does a nice job of dealing with this situation and Davis and Petty are very real as fighting

but loving sisters

They both want what is best for each other

You can see all of the women on the baseball team come alive as they realize that they can do anything that they set their mind to do

If you like anything directed by Penny Marshall

then you will be seeing her at her best

A League of Their Own is definitely in a league of its own
