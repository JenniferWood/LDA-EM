Godzilla vs

the Thing is actually the correct title

The movie was awsome compared to the disapointments that came befor and after it (by which I mean King Kong vs

Godzilla and Ghidrah

the Three Headed Monster)

Godzilla looked waaaaaaaaaaaay better than that baggy alligator they showed in King Kong vs

Godzilla

This one is a must-see
