Steven Spielberg asked Ray Bradbury

the legendary author of such works The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451

&#34;How do you like your film

Close Encounters wouldn't have been born if I hadn't seen It Came from Outer Space six times when I was a kid

&#34; Bradbury had written the original treatment for that 1953 film

Indeed

Close Encounters and other Spielberg works would seem to owe a lot to author Ray Bradbury

According to film historian and critic Joseph McBride

Jean Renoir compared Spielberg's storytelling in this picture to Jules Verne and Georges Meli&eacute;s

At its heart

Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a simple fantasy that depicts the first formal meeting of humans and aliens

Although the film certainly features the global point of view and shows how governments might respond to this event

Spielberg wisely took the more intimate approach to tell the story

All three versions are presented in brand new 1080p transfers in the movie's 2

35:1 widescreen aspect ratio

The transfer is splendid to say the least and is richer in colour than ever

The black levels and contrast are simply amazing and will leave you speechless

while the colours are incredibly rich and saturated

The vibrant lights of the alien spaceships have never been so lucid

It is an incredible feast for the eye adding a completely new dimension to the film

Close Encounters was Spielberg&#8217;s first film after the enormous success of 1975&#8217;s Jaws

and it represents a more personal project

While he clearly made Jaws his movie

he still functioned as a &#8220;hired hand&#8221; for the film

He could take some liberties with the tale

but since the book had been so successful in its own right

there was only so much he could do to give Jaws his own stamp

Roy Neary [Richard Dreyfuss] works as a technician for an Indiana power company and lives with his wife Ronnie [Teri Garr] and three kids

He seems like a nice enough guy

but clearly the bloom is off the rose and he&#8217;s living a fairly drab existence

All of that changes when some force causes electricity to cut off all across his area

After he&#8217;s sent to work on the situation

he comes quite close to some alien vehicles

and the experience leaves him changed

to say the least

From then on

he feels a nagging urge to find meaning in odd shapes

a desire that eventually leads him to apparent semi-madness

However

that&#8217;s not the case

and before too long Roy Neary and others - including Jillian Guiler [Melinda Dillon]

whose son Barry [Cary Guffey] has been kidnapped by the aliens - figure out what it is they need to do

and he heads out west for&#8230; well

he&#8217;s not sure what

Nor are we

but it&#8217;s a terrific ride as Roy and Jillian have to evade oppressive government forces to reach their ultimate goal

Is Close Encounters of the Third Kind a flawless movie

No

it has its own problems at times

For example

I always thought the aggressive way in which the aliens came to get Barry seemed to be at odds with their apparently-gentle nature; the abduction makes sense within the tone of the movie because it adds excitement and intrigue

but it didn&#8217;t really seem logical to me

Nonetheless

the film functions at a consistently high level from start to finish and offers an extremely well-executed fantasy

The acting is top-notch from Richard Dreyfuss down the line

Through movies like Jaws and The Goodbye Girl - another 1977 offering

and one for which he earned an Academy Award &#8211; Richard Dreyfuss became moderately pigeonholed as a sarcastic

self-centred sort of character

Close Encounters of the Third Kind showed that he could easily portray other roles

and he brings off the middle-class dreamer in Roy Neary very nicely

Spielberg paced the film well

and though the effects have aged

they still hold up after almost a quarter of a century

It achieves a level of beauty and tenderness rare in the genre

and it also combines well-integrated humour

drama and action

As a whole

Close Encounters of the Third Kind remains a totally fabulous piece of work that deserves to be included along with the greatest films ever made

Spielberg reworked the movie again in 1998

This 137-minute &#8220;Director&#8217;s Cut&#8221; combines different aspects of the 1977 and 1980 versions

Many think this is the best edition of the movie

and I might agree

but some good bits from the 1977 film fail to appear

The introduction to the Neary&#8217;s uses the scene from the 1980 cut

which is more abrupt but it adds some nice exposition to the family

so it&#8217;s a draw

Other 1980 snippets are integrated

such as &#8220;Roy&#8217;s shower&#8221; and the expedition to the Gobi Desert

The 1998 version cuts some segments that appeared in both the 1977 and 1980 versions

and these are the least positive changes

We lose the cool scene in which Roy looks at a pillowcase and states

&#8220;That&#8217;s not right&#8221;

We also don&#8217;t get some shots of Roy at the power plant; I liked these

but I can&#8217;t say they&#8217;re as painful to lose as the pillowcase

The alterations don&#8217;t hurt the movie terribly

but I wish Spielberg had kept these scenes in the movie

When I consider the three versions

I find it hard to choose between the Theatrical edition or the Director&#8217;s Cut

Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; Close Encounters of the Third Kind appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 2

35:1; on this Blu-ray Disc

Very few concerns emerged during this terrific transfer

Sharpness usually seemed to be excellent

A few wide shots presented some very slight softness

but that was about it

and those tended to occur either due to effects or depth of field issues

The vast majority of the film offered strong delineation and clarity

No issues with jagged edges or shimmering occurred

and I noticed no signs of edge enhancement

I also found no source flaws

The source material could be grainy at times

but no artificial defects appeared

Colours looked quite natural and distinct

The film didn&#8217;t feature a particular bright palette except for the hues generated by the alien crafts themselves

and I felt these tones appeared clear and vivid

Black levels occasionally looked a little too pale

but they usually appeared appropriately deep and dense

and shadow detail seemed clean and nicely heavy without excessive opacity

The smattering of slightly soft shots created my only minor complaints here

and they weren&#8217;t enough to knock my grade below an &#8220;A&#8220;

I felt very pleased with this transfer

as it often looked absolutely exceptional

Blu-ray Audio Quality - The soundtracks of Close Encounters displayed some minor problems but they nonetheless worked quite well for a film of this vintage

Close Encounters offers both 5

1 Dolby Digital TrueHD and 5

1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround soundtracks

The track featured a surprisingly broad and engaging sound-field

The front speakers offered a nice sense of ambience; in addition to John Williams&#8217; score

they added a great deal of unique effects

all of which seemed to be well placed within the environment

The elements also blended together neatly and smoothly

Some directional dialogue occurred

and while it could seem somewhat tentative at times

for the most part I felt that the speech appeared to come from the appropriate locations

John Williams&#8217; score also presented nice dynamics

and the music appeared to be bright and vivid throughout the movie

Some hiss accompanied the track

and this defect seemed connected to the music; it only cropped up when the score became more prominent

Frankly

I really liked the soundtrack of Close Encounters; were it not for some of the edginess to speech and the thinness of the effectsBlu-ray Special Features and Extras:A View from Above - Replicating the printed version of the technical timeline outlined above

activate this feature and

depending on which version of the film you're watching

color-coded notations will appear that describe the various changes made to that particular cut

Again

very cool and another nice addition to this brilliant Blu-ray disc

Finally

'Close Encounters' is still so etched in the popular consciousness that it's hard to believe that it's been thirty years since it first hit theatres

Although the film has been released in a myriad of different versions (all presented in full on this Blu-ray)

whichever version you personally prefer

and the film remains an uplifting experience that's an absolute landmark of the science fiction genre

I've never seen the film look or sound better

and the extras are a bit of a disappointment with this Limited SteelBook

But to top it all

this Limited SteelBook packaging is very impressive

and you've got a great release that easily earns its brilliant price tag

Mr

Spielberg

I'm ecstatic that you've finally jumped into high-def with 'Close Encounters

' and I can't wait to see what's next

But until then

I am so honoured to have this in my Blu-ray Collection as the Limited SteelBook is so beautiful looking and despite the lack of extras

it was still my preferred choice

Highly Recommended
