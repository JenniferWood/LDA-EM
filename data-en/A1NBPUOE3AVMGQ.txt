This is such a classic film

it's hard to review

So great to see special effects that were really special

and not just a bunch of CGI

The acting is superb

the story is beautiful and inspiring

and the added material on the DVD edition was really neat to see

If you've seen this film

then you probably know what a jewel it is

If you haven't -- you should
