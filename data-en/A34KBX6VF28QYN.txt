A classic not only of thoughtful science fiction in the tradition of &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;

but of cryptic suggestion: Dozens of threads are tied together only slowly

as the viewer gains slowly more and more access to the facts

Built on a rock-solid performance by Richard Dreyfuss

this is one of the true greats
