This series

first shown on Masterpiece Theatre

has everything

including romance

comedy and sex

sometimes at the same time

All of the actors are wonderful

displaying perfect comic timing

The dramatic scenes are often poignant

The love story may be central to the plot

but the adventures of Anna and Owen touch the lives of their relatives

friends and business associates in unexpected ways

The settings range from city

to lush countryside to a working man's neighborhood and pub

to a bustling hospital

There's lots of action as well as some incredibly steamy love scenes

Reckless is a series to watch more than once

I never tire of revisiting Anna and Owen and all the other characters
