Before i even begin this review

it is telling that many of the people who gave this movie a one or a two star rating are either referring to the DVD reissue (not the movie plot)

or are actually reviewing THE WRONG MOVIE (come on

people





)Anyway

Godzilla vs the Thing (1964) was and still is my favourite Godzilla film

A giant egg washes ashore

and greedy

unscrupulous businessmen try to exploit the situation

When Mothra's twin fairies try to reason with them

the crooks try to kidnap/steal them as well

While this is going on

who should resurface but Godzilla (in the BEST appearance in any film

) He appears in a sand dune with first his huge tail lashing about

and then the big lizard himself

Now

Japan needs the fairies and infant island natives to ask Mothra for assistance

Needless to say

they are still a bit miffed and refuse

but when our heroes (did i forget to mention the good-guy humans who star in this

Sorry) plead with the fairies

they agree

Sadly though

Mothra is dying of old age

and doesn't have the strength to even return home if she leaves

Despite her geriatric senior citizenship

Mothra the moth puts up a good fight against Godzilla

Knocking him down with her winds

poisoning him with her yellow pollen

and even dragging him by the tail

But Godzilla manages to get up and spit radioactive fire in her face

With that and a damaged wing

older Mothra succumbs

But in a touching scene

she manages to knock down Godzilla again when he tries to finish her off

and flies to her egg

putting a wing protectively over her offspring

(I actually cried as a kid when that happened)The fairies sing and chant to get the egg to hatch

In the meantime

the human military fights Godzilla

The weapons aren't completely useless

but the bombs and missiles don't do much but give Godzilla pause (a STUNNING scene was actually an accident-an explosion made the rubber suit catch fire

I still remember seeing that in the old theater with my mates and being astounded (in the early 80s

a movie theater showed the classic monster films on Saturday afternoons)

The humans actually had an effective weapon with a trio of superconducting electro-nets delivered by helicopters in conjunction with electricity being shot at Godzilla

The detail giving to the animated of the sparks is telling-after each net

the electricity shocking Godzilla got more intense

This actually would have worked if the STUPID general in charge didn't demand they increase power when the \"Scotty-like\" soldier said that he was giving as much power as he could and the engines couldn't take any more

(Sorry

i had to throw a Star Trek joke in there) Of course when they followed his orders and increased power anyway

wires burnt out

and the generator shorted

This gave time for the twin Mothra larvae to hatch

They followed Godzilla to an island (where he was going to pick on some kids and their schoolteacher) and fought him to a finish

Using their silk spray

they encased Godzilla and threw him into the ocean

(I always liked the scene with them squeaking on top of the mountain after he fell-i always imagined them to be saying

\"And don't come back

you ugly green lizard

\")After all the action is done

the caterpillars give their friends the fairies a ride back to infant island

with our human heroes waving goodbye

and being determined to stop corporate greed

Ok

that's the plot-now onto the effects:Yes

the movie is almost 50 years old

Yes

Japanese monster films are not known for their cutting edge effects

But i still think that starting with this film

the effects have drastically improved

Watch the stop-motion of Godzilla Raids Again (1959)

along with the sumo wrestling of Godzilla vs King Kong (1962)

The puppets that the actor in the suit fights seem more real

I think that Honda (the director of Godzilla

not the auto company) realised this too

because throughout the 60s

almost all of the films had Godzilla fighting at least one puppet and not just men in suits (except Godzilla's Revenge

and don't even get me started on how bad that one is

I couldn't even watch it as a wide-eyed pre-teen without laughing

I mean i'd rather see Gamera

(A very underrated series by the way)This is the last movie (until Godzilla 1985) where Godzilla is a \"bad guy\" throughout the entire film

The suit is FAB too-the eyes and the jerky motions of the actor inside make Godzilla look positively EVIL

Especially in the scene where he was going to attack the egg (before Mothra the moth arrived) and when he was going to finish Mothra off

Those eyes were chillingly cold-blooded

I am always saddened that kids today are jaded by violent

indecent movies

This film has explosions and stuff

but still is a gentle sci-fi \"horror\" flick-not the stuff of nightmares or sick indecent \"entertainment\" A good family film that i recommend highly
