This movie is extremely well made

It is so touching when Joseph's brothers throw him into a pit

His crying and pleading with them to be merciful is so moving as is the part when Joseph finally meets his brothers again and tells them who he really is

Exceptionally well made

I recommend this movie as high as possible

A true hero in a world of doubt and sorrows it helps to know that human issues of understanding

forgiveness and love are always with us and always have been
