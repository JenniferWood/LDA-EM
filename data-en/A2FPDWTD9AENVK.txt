A typhoon causes an enormous egg to wash ashore the beaches of Japan

where the greedy owner of Happy Enterprises is quick to claim it as his own in an attempt to exploit the scientific wonder as a tourist attraction

A pair of skeptical news reporters grow suspicious of his actions when they are approached by the two tiny Infant Island twins

who reveal that the egg belongs Mothra and that it must be returned lest they incur Mothra's wrath

but before the it has the chance to hatch

Godzilla resurfaces on a destructive path towards the egg

The two gargantuan monsters clash in the earth-shattering finale of MOTHRA VS

GODZILLA

The fourth film in the series pits the unstoppable force of nature against Earth's winged guardian in one of Godzilla's finest sequels

Screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa delivers another playful and inventive script

with a central focus on the human element that is also indicative of Ishiro Honda's particular style

MOTHRA VS

GODZILLA sees the return of the Peanut Twins as Mothra's two protectors

who are imaginatively shrunken down to their miniature size as they try to warn of the coming danger

The battle that persists between Mothra and Godzilla is a spectacle

indeed

offering a wide range of attacks that keep the action fresh and exciting

Godzilla's appearance has started to become more anthropomorphized

with a shortened snout and forward-facing eyes

Akira Ifukube provides another wonderful reprisal of his dramatic scores

with more stunning miniatures and special effects by master craftsman Eiji Tsuburaya

This memorable entry in the series is beloved by fans and ranks very highly within the series
