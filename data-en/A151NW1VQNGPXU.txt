I adore this movie

flaws and all

Yes

there are errors in the plot sequence and the filming

Yes

there are obvious cheesy characteristics that don't seem to belong in a Coppola film; however

this is an endearing film that I have watched many

many times

It never gets old for me

The retro styling of this film is just part of the draw

I also love the undertones of the film's theme: what if

I think most people look back at all of our stupid adolescent mistakes and wonder what would happen if we could go back and relive it

Peggy Sue gets the chance

and finds that the choices that she originally made were not necessarily bad ones

She and Charlie were drawn each other as teenagers

and even when she relives her high school years

she finds that the same is true

She knows that he's flawed

and she also knows what the future will hold for them

but she couldn't deny that at that point in time

they were drawn toward each other for a reason

Do things happen for a reason

If Charlie would have sung a Beatles song

would it have been as popular

Peggy Sue tried to alter some of the aspects of her life

but she also seemed to find that she was powerless to alter the major parts

She could chase the \"hip thinking\" poet

but could she truly be happy with him

Could she walk away from Charlie and find happiness with someone else

thus altering what she knew to be her future

The plot is a bit hokey

but it does get you thinking

If you did get a chance

would it really be all that different

On one hand

you want to say yes

while on the other hand

we all know that time distorts our perception of things

Would we really do it all differently if given the chance

Perhaps not

It maybe for this question alone that you'd want to watch this film with good friends and ponder that question
