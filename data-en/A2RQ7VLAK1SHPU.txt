It is a departure from the original

but still a nice story

Liam Neeson absolutely masters the role of Jean Valjean

I recommend this version for those who just want Jean Valjean's story

The latest musical version (2012) is much more of a departure from the book

Since all the songs were recorded at the time of filming and not in a studio

there are a number of very noticeable flats and sharps

as well as being unpleasant to listen to for the sake of staying &#34;in character&#34; and &#34;in the moment

&#34;If you want music

the 25th Anniversary special performance is the one to get

The beautiful

operatic voices (Alfie Bowe

Ramin Karimloo

Norm Lewis

Lea Salonga

and many others) will capture your heart and imagination

The character voice talents (especially the Tenardiers

with funny man

Matt Lucas)
