Fans like me who were first introduced to Robson Green as the intellectual and quite asexual Dr

Tony Hill on \"Wire in the Blood\" are in for a treat

In \"Reckless\"

a much younger Mr

Green plays another doctor with a much warmer

more open and comedic attitude that's probably closer to the actor as he is in personal life

Reminiscent at times of a young Mel Gibson

the impetuous and barely bridled sexual charisma that percolates under the surface of Tony Hill is let out in full display in Owen Springer

and we are powerless to resist

I can't imagine too many men will cop to liking this movie

unless they are gay

It unabashedly plays to female fantasies--how many gorgeous young men would actually stand in a pouring rain and say \"I think I'm in love with you\"

A completely unrealistic scenario

perhaps

but one guaranteed to leave a woman weak in the knees

especially delivered with such blue-eyed sincerity as Mr

Green musters

The plot revolves around marital infidelity and not even the luscious Mr

Green can make that palatable

but we are willing to put aside our distaste because that blue gaze is hypnotic

I haven't even seen the second half yet

but I imagine that even more of Mr

Green's juicy posterior will be on offer

I'm not complaining about that

I'm just surprised that the faintly pretentious \"Masterpiece Theatre\" would go with something so softcore and frankly titillating

Alaistair Cooke might have rolled over in his grave

If you're a fan of Mr

Green from his police procedurals

tune into this for a completely different taste of his range

Mr

Green is indeed a well-rounded actor

and I mean that in every sense possible
