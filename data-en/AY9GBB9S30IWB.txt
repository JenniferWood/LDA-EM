This is my favirote Godzilla movie

All of the monsters look good

The main human charaters are not boring to wacth

Its just great kaiju movie

This set includes both Japanese and American versions

So think about before you the Classic Media's older Mothra VS

Godzilla DVD from 2002

It starts when a giant egg is found in the ocean

Then 2 men buy it and plan to make a theme park out of it

2 faries from Infant Island come to ask the men to give the egg back

The faries fail and they barley escape from being captured

Meanwhile

while testing some radiation Godzilla comes out of the testing ground and attacks Tokyo

So

Japan asks the people from Infant Island to send Mothra to fight Godzilla

After a bunch odf explaining they agree

But Mothra will die very shortly but she flys to tokyo anyway

Dont worry I wont spoil the ending

The Godzilla suit used in this movie was VERY shaky

But grat movie

This is the best Godzilla movie ever
