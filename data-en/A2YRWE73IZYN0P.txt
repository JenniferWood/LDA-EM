I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience

but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s

which is fine

but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally

and he seems to be in his early-thirties

Yet just fifteen years later

during the Great Depression

he's a very old man

So what's the deal

It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around

so they decided to twist time around to fit the props

It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution

then a young man during WWI

then a very old man during the Depression

Very odd

I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available

they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact

When Slade sees his gravestone

it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene

and in his mid-fifties in 1933

when the film is supposed to be taking place

Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher

but this part always bugged me

Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense

but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later

They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props

) making his age in 1933 more believable

Oh well

great movie
