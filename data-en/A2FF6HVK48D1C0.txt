A sometimes bawdy

bouncy

entertaining

smooth

sometimes moving

sometimes overemotional comedy based on the real-life All American Girls Professional Baseball League

My favorite scenes are the early scenes with the grousing scout played by Jon Lovitz

\"See

the way it works is

the train moves

not the station

\" The rest of the way

the film is uneven

sometimes hitting the mark

but other times (like the framing scenes) missing

Although \"A League of Their Own\" deals with a worthy theme and has a lot of charm

it sometimes goes for cheap laughs and tears and occasionally veers into gratuitous sacrilege

Finally

as a longtime Cleveland resident

I assure you

there IS crying in baseball
