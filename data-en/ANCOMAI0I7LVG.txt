I didn't expect to like this movie much at all

I mean

this is a baseball movie (not a fan) starring Tom Hanks (also not a fan) and yet Geena Davis is amazing in almost everything and the idea of watching her command a film (and a baseball team) had me intrigued

That

and my wife loves the movie and wanted me to watch it with her

I loved this

Penny Marshall is like the female version of Ron Howard for me

I've said this before and the more films I see from either of them the more I'm convinced that they personally had/have the market on schmaltzy saccharine dramas cornered

They just get it

It is very hard to make schmaltz work

but they do

Their films are so manipulative and yet I just love them for it

Other directors try and to the same thing and I chastise them for it

but let Marshall serve up a convulsing De Niro or Howard a penniless Crowe and I'm sold (and bawling)

Here

Penny Marshall uses All-American Girls Professional Baseball as a catalyst for life lessons

familial bonds and comradely

Taking place during World War II

`A League of Their Own' focuses on the birth of the AAGPBL and settles in on a rivalry that forms between two sisters

Dottie is beautiful and talented and a born leader

She is also married and satisfied with her life on the farm

waiting for her husband to return from the war so they can start a family

Her sister Kit is less attractive and less talented

but headstrong and determined to get out of her small town

Together they are recruited to join the AAGPBL and soon Dottie becomes a star of sorts and her sister becomes envious of the attention showered on Dottie

With a drunk for a coach (Hanks

in fine form)

the team begins to form their own identity

but with the collapse of the league looming overhead (with the war ending

many don't find it necessary) there is more at stake for these women than `a bad game'

The performances by the entire cast are exceptional

Davis is wonderful

balanced and commanding

Hanks delivers one of his finer moments

more relaxed and engaged and uses comedic timing to his advantage (he's always been a better comedian than dramatic actor)

Petty is fine in her conflicted aggression and both O'Donnell and Cavanagh serve up prime comedic relief

Madonna is remarkable here

and may be best in show (with regards to the supporting cast)

I was truly surprised by the depth she brought to her character

The film is wholly entertaining

It has a great flow and uses such soft touches of style to pull in the film's setting and make it feel lived in and real

The script is spot on

giving such life to these women and making them a part of our family

With expert direction

a solid story and an amazing cast

`A League of Their Own' is one for the ages
