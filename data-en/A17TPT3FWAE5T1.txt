If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge

1951)

the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr

Magoo's Christmas Carol (no

I'm not kidding

it's beautifully done)

this will be an interesting film for comparison

Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story:1) Since it is an adaptation

set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England)

deviations from the text and basic plot-line

are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in \"Dickensian\" England

2) Henry Winkler

who

at the time

was playing against his well-known Fonz character

gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade

George C

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version

and the films that feature them have good production values -- and

in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what

) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying
