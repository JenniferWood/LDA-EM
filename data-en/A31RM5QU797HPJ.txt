A classic christmas program from Jim Henson's Muppets

I taped from TV a long time ago

but that tape broke

I bought it on VHS and was shocked that Kermit's closing remarks weren't there

Also

Alice Otter and Gretchen Fox's scece was shorterned

It was a great TV special

but the VHS doesn't compare
