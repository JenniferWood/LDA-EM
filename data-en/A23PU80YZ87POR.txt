This is one of my favorite Sci-fi movies of all time

The storyline captures the personal experience of people who have a first &#34;close encounter&#34; with extraterrestrial life and their migration to a site where contact is made

Wonderful visual effects

Richard Dreyfuss was excellent in this film

This was my first HD movie that I &#34;bought&#34; for my Kindle fire
