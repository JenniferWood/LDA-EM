From the moment I saw the preview of Reckless on A&E I wanted to see it

I enjoyed it so much I wanted to get it on DVD

I was not disappointed with my purchases

The movies are clear and the commentary at the beginning builds your anticipation if you haven't seen the movie before

I also got the Sequel and I enjoyed it also

I saw so many angles in the story-plot

and I learned something from the story the four times I've watched it; I know I will be watching it many more times

I liked the relationship between Owen and Anna

and I disliked Anna's egotistical husband who deserved what he got
