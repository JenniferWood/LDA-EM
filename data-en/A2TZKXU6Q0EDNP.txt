It had been years since I had watched this film and i wanted to see whether it would have the same impact on me as it when i saw it almost 20 years ago

Perhaps unsurprisingly it was every bit as intimidating

eerie

and tremendously entertaining as it was back then

Ask any UFO buff and he/she'll tell you that when it comes to films about the &quot;objects in the sky&quot; there are very few

extremely few

that can demand good notes from the audiences

&quot;Close encounters&quot; is definately one of them

a film that despite a near 30 yrs after its release it still jumps at you (small screen or big) and is at the same time thought provoking

Spielberg has some tremendous (especially at the box office) hits under his belt but in the minds of many this might be one of his very best films

If not the best

As &quot;they&quot; arrive with lightning-speed craft that cruise the skies of a small american town

scanning and patroling while getting the attention of every local in sight it seems like a collective obsession takes over the residents and the viewers together

What do they want

Who are they

The questions

the fear

the immense intimidation

the complications and the implications come through in brilliant manner through all the characters that parade through this classic film

But what still impresses is that &quot;Close encounters&quot; manages to remain intelligent even if you see it today

That might soundlike a moot point to those that love this film but it's a legitimate point

Spielberg doesnt ridicule the issue

doesnt attempt to offer some laughable debunking

doesnt dismiss it

but instead takes it full-on with the seriousness it demands

And even when the film has its funny moments the focus isnt lost for a single second

All the more wowing is the fact that effects still look pretty damn good and i saw it in my small living room TV

Sure

it might reek of that 70s aura all along but that's inevitable and it really doeasn't come across as annoying

if anything that even adds to the charm

Funny and certinaly bizzare that I havent seen a good film with this theme in a long

long while

unless we consider braindead disasters like &quot;Independence day&quot; contenders

This is why i picked up to the DVD and the reward factor was immense

The extra features on this limited edition disc are seriously interesting as well

Way up there with the cinematic classics regardless of genre

If you havent seen this check it out

Timeless stuff
