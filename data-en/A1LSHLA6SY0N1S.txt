How wonderful that a story about precognitive dreams has become such a famous and beautiful story

We are all wise to pay attention to our dreams

but not all of us have a talented and high-minded interpreter like Joseph

Even Freud in \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" admits that precognitive dreams are not unusual
