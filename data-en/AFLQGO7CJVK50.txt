This is not a documentary or a reality show about aliens from outer space

This is a fictional adventure movie about people who feel compelled to visit a certain mountain in western America and do not know why

All of them share the same visions and dreams of this mountain

When they get there

they are greeted by military troops galore

When they do get to the top of the mountain

they realize the true source of their shared visions and what they find there will shock and amaze you

If I say anymore it will ruin the movie

This is not war movie or action movie by any means

but it still has some suspense and a sense of mystery about it

The 70's can truly boast about THIS one
