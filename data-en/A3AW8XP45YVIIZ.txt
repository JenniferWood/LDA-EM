This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph

Joseph is the most loved son of his father

and has a gift for prophecy

His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery

Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah

During a famine

Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain

not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead)

This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament

I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series

but this is the best of a strong series in my view

The acting is top notch

and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done

Like many of the films in this series

it is a story about faith and perserverance

The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads

One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone

These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands

but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale

The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious

The bottom line is that this is

in my opinion

the way that the Bible should be brought to film
