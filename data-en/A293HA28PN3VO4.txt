This review is for the Blu-Ray and it was viewed on a 42\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player

I am 33 years old

and must confess that I had never seen this film in its entirety

As I am a huge fan of Alien and similarly themed films

I decided to make this the day to start my journey into this disc set

I watched the original \"Theatrical\" ed

and will update my review as I watch the others

PQ 3

5 and AQ 5

I was a little disappointed in the picture quality

which displays noticable grain

I've seen old films with better PQ

First

the performance of the lead character was one of the most heartfelt I've ever seen

His desire to explore and be a part of this otherworldly miracle is just stirring

I absolutely loved the score

I think that music and scoring was

perhaps used much more effectively in this time period

The effects

even for an older film

were outstanding and with a little suspension of disbelief-convincing

The space ship at the end is just incredible

as is the return of the other \"abductees\"

This is a great story

and masterpiece by Spielberg

Many elements are precursors for modern day Sci-Fi movies

series and themes in our cinematic experience

I am certainly glad to own this set

and look forward to watching the other versions another time

along with the special features
