I am happy I got to see this and it plays on my UK DVD player

Mr Slade is as nasty as all the other Scrooges and you can tell who the characters are

Slade is Mr Scrooge and Thatcher is meant to be Bob Cratchet

I am happy that I got to see this DVD because that is the only Christmas Carol DVD that I have not seen
