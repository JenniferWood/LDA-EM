If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife

this movie would have been excellent

That scene was so sensual that it was borderline \"R\" rated in our book

I almost shut it off at that scene

Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off

leaving his garment behind him

there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts

He doesn't flee that time

This scene ruined the movie for us

and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series

we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene

Too bad
