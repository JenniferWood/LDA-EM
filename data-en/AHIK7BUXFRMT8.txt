We watched this movie for the first time recently and fell in love with it; it is entertaining and fun to watch and both Nicholas Cage and Shirley Maclaine turn in stellar performances

Shirley Maclaine plays the role of Tess Carlisle

a former \"First Lady\" who is suddenly taken out of circulation when her President husband dies of a heart attack

Nicholas Cage plays the role of a disgruntled Secret Service agent

Doug Chesnic

who is assigned the job of protecting her

This is the story of a love/hate relationship that helps define them both

Both

in their own ways

feel as if they've been put out to pasture before their time and are not happy with the situation

Tess loves attention and has not adjusted well to the private life of a former First Lady

Doug feels as if he has been forgotten about and must play nursemaid to a cantankerous female who seems to delight in making his life a misery

Tess has

however

a secret which is influencing her decisions and colors her outlook on life

Circumstances take a strange twist when something serious happens to Tess and Doug must suddenly leap into action to save her

The secnery

acting and casting at all levels is excellent and provides solid family entertainment

I recommend it highly

it's a lot of fun to watch
