This is a really enjoyable film the first time you watch it

It shocks you at the cruelty of it but you continue to watch

However

it's not a movie you'll likely watch over and over again in your free time

I use \"enjoyable\" insofar as if you like originality despite its offensiveness

No doubt

if you are female and especially disabled

will find this movie offensive

That does not detract from its inherent originality

That being said

multiple viewings diminish the impact of the movie and eventually render it impotent

It hits you at first

but afterwards you grow numb to its \"shock value

\" Buy it if you plan on watching it every few years because otherwise

you'll grow quite tired of it

no matter how good it is
