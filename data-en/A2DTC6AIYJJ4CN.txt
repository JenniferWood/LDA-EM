We recently purchased this 2 disc Special Collection DVD

We love this movie and we are very glad to now own it

I think they did a good job with the \"Extras\" in the 2nd disc taking into consideration the age of the movie and all pieces collected for the Extras

We always like to see whatever they have that has happened behind the scenes while making the movie and how it all came about

The movie is a great classic of course and a winner

This is definitely a keeper for our collection and I highly recommend it
