I thought the movie was sufficiently close to the Bible story

The sets were often lacking

but I enjoyed the movie anyway

I had a copy that I bought with the Bible Collection 7 or 8 years ago that I loaned out and never got back

I was happy to get this at around $7

I recommend the Bible Collection highly
