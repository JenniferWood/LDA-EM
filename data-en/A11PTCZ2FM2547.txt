Let's face it: Tom Hanks owned the decade that was the 1990s

Apollo 13

Forrest Gump

Saving Private Ryan

The Green Mile

(I could go on

but you get my point; I could post links to all these films

but I'm too lazy

so my apologies

) Add to this list the uplifting film A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN

a movie based on the actual All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL)

Hanks plays crusty Jimmy Dugan

a liquored-up and washed-up player with a bad knee; Dugan is given a shot managing the upstart Rockford Peaches

a task he lacks considerable enthusiasm in performing

and the stage is set for a clash in the clubhouse

as women in the World War II era playing America's game in a misogynistic culture begs confrontation

The tension is the motor that drives the story

as Dugan gets a baptism by fire into an estrogen-driven environment

when emotions are worn on short sleeves

And it's extremely entertaining to watch (\"There's no crying in baseball

\" is one of the best lines in all of cinema)

as the Rockford Peaches and their manager close ranks as the season progresses--first to keep the franchise from folding; second to win the inaugural AAGPBL World Series

The cast is fantastic; along with Hanks

Geena Davis and Lori Petty are stellar as combative sisters Dottie and Kit

Dottie is the best player on the team as the Peaches' catcher and team captain; Lori is a darn good pitcher yearning to be out of her big sister's shadow

The supporting cast includes Jon Lovitz

the always good David Strathairn

a surprisingly good Madonna

and one annoying Rosie O'Donnell in her big screen debut

(I kept waiting for Rosie to take a line drive in the kisser

but alas





) Granted

the plot is predictable

including the botched tag that determines the World Series winner

yet the poignant and bittersweet reunion of the Peaches as the Baseball Hall of Fame opens its AAGPBL exhibit

is priceless

So Hanks may have owned the Nineties

but A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN will continue to enthrall viewers no matter the decade
