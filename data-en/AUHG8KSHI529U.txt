This is both a serious movie and a parable

Toshir Mifune plays Captain TsuruhikoKuroda

a proud Japanese Naval officer and Lee Marvin plays a downed American Pilot

They both end up on a deserted small island

They are mortal enemies

but somehow when you are both staring death in the face

it is easier to make common cause against it

The story of the movie is how they overcome their hatred for each other (in the generic - wartime sense) to find a way to be found

signal for help

or get off the island somehow

someway

Both actors are superb

The parable is appropriate for a world ravaged by two-world wars the previous sixty years and now facing nuclear annihilation

We need to pull together or we will die at each other's through for no good reason

While I don't want to reveal what happens

it is instructive how vanishing cooperation and friendship are once the immediate threat seems to be past

As I watched the movie

I could see how the Cast Away and Enemy Mine both seemed to learn and use things from this film

I think it is a pretty good film that should be seen yet today
