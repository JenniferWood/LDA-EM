Powerful

moving and heart-warming drama that is based on a true story

Hard-nosed school principal Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) who also goes by 'Crazy Joe' is asked by two school board members to try and shape up the under-achieving New Jersey's East Side High

The student body is mostly made up of African-American and Hispanic kids

Many good scenes and rather good direction here

I thought

In the end

Mr

Clark winds up with the respect and devotion from at least most if not all the students as well the teachers

I guess the moral of this flick is that 'tough love' really can pay off in a big way

If you liked the movie 'The Principal'

you should get a lot from this title
