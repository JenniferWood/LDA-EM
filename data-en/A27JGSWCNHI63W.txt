This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid

These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told

Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs

never the less

it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be

for the most part

some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film

with or without a big budget

My favorite is the story of Abram

the movie Joseph coming in a close second

and this movie

Moses

coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph

Bravo bravo - Please make more

My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others

but the effort is exemplary
