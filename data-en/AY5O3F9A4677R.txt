I saw this movie for the first time with my mother

who was a war bride of World War II

like many of the girls in this league

It is a chick flick that shows how women's roles were changing with the war and how hard the war was on the girls waiting at home

I love the \"truth in story\" part of all good literature and good film

This is definitely the latter

with good acting on all fronts

even Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna

whom I don't automatically think of as actors

They are

though

and very respectable ones too

Tom Hanks demonstrates his versatility yet again

portraying a crude

hard-drinking

tobacco-spitting coach on a downhill slide

\"stuck

\" or so he sees it

with a league of women as punishment for his sins

It's the complete opposite of his role in PHILADELPHIA

but his portrayal is heart-warming and funny

Watch it and see your moms and your grandmoms

living through this time period

It's fun

interesting

and moving at the same time
