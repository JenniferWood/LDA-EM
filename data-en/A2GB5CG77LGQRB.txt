Guarding TessScore: 71/100Guarding Tess is an unexpected and cheery film that has a strong power to be able to mix comedic situations and dramatically emotional scripting

That's quite a plausible thing about this movie

and the rest of it enjoyable too

Even though it lets itself down a couple of times

Guarding Tess is still enjoyable none-the-less

and will appeal to many audiences

Doug (Nicolas Cage) is a Secret Service Agent who has just completed his stint in charge protecting Tess Carlisle (Shirley MacLaine)

widow of a former U

S

President

and close personal friend of the President

He finds that she has requested that he not be rotated but instead return to be her permanent detail

Doug is crushed

He wants off her detail

She is very difficult to guard and makes her detail crazy with her whims and demands

Doug returns with no idea of how to continue dealing with her

Guarding Tess has most of the things to please a willing audience: an original and effective story

2 pitch-perfect performances from Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine

some intriguing realistic situations and bright reviews from the critics

I found all of these things to be very impressive facts about the movie

especially the storyline

which dreams up tonnes of ideas as to why Tess should be a pain

The characters are original and you can relate to some of the messes they get into

especially the Doug's craziness of wanting to get away from Tess and do some real Secret Service work

There are a few flaws that stop the movie from being as stunning as their 2 main performers

The comedy never really hits the spot as well as it should

Sure

there are a couple of unashamed giggles

but with a premise so neat

you should expect laughs-out-loud and a lot of them

The film also could've ended better

but you'll still have a good time

guaranteed

Guarding Tess is a good and old-fashioned movie that has a strong mind to please it's audience

And it does

with charm and style
