Peggy Sue is a bored

unhappy middle-aged mother whose marriage to Charlie Bodell

her childhood sweetheart

is on the rocks

At a high school reunion Peggy Sue collapses and wakes to find she has somehow been transported back to her teen years

As she gets over the initial shock she realises she has the chance to relive her life and maybe make some drastic changes

She also realises she can change the lives of those around her

such as when she encourages one class mate to invent panty-hose and encourages others to invest in things she knows will succeed in the future

Of course those around Peggy Sue are confused by her newly serious nature

particularly Charlie who cannot understand why she is so cool toward him

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola

the film stars Nicholas Cage as Charlie and Kathleen Turner as Peggy Sue

and watch out for a very young Jim Carrey as Walter

a friend of the young couple

Although the lead actors play their parts well

and try to be believable as teenagers

the fact that they both look far to old to be teens does detract from the film a little

That aside

this is a heart-warming film with some very witty moments

It will make you laugh and cry in equal amounts and

although it looks a little dated now

it is still worth a look
