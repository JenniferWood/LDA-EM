Saw this one in the theater on my tenth birthday

and it was the most amazing movie I had ever seen up to that point

more amazing even than &quot;Star Wars&quot;

which came out the same year

I remember my Dad lamenting to my Mom when we got home that night

&quot;There wasn't any real violence in it





just a cop car crashing

&quot; Many people like my Dad probably thought this film just wasn't for adults

After all

it was a feel-good

non-violent film with a wide-eyed little kid in it

and nobody (except the cop in the car wreck)

really got hurt

The aliens were cute and friendly

too

Some people

like Dad

have naturally made the mistake over the years of thinking that &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was just a kid's movie

But that was never so; if you take a close look

you'll see a very serious

intellegent film

There are really spooky

frightening moments that kids may or may not understand

Who can watch the abduction sequence or the Neary's encounter at the train crossing

and still say this was a kid's movie

Watching this film again

in pristine DVD clarity

reminded me of just how little talent and creativity remains in Hollywood these days

As awesome as the effects in &quot;Close Encounters&quot; were (and still are)

they never overpower the human element

Today

sci-fi is filled with a glut of pointless CGI

explosions

cleavage

mindless action

and violence

in place of real human characters interacting

How refreshing to look back and see a film from a simpler

more idealistic time when ideas and original concepts still exited

I thought back to all the films and TV shows that came out around the same time; &quot;Star Wars&quot;

&quot;Silent Running&quot;

&quot;Tron&quot;

&quot;The Black Hole&quot;

&quot;Logan's Run&quot;

&quot;Space:1999&quot;

&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;

&quot;Buck Rogers&quot;

Heck

for that matter

even &quot;Damnation Alley&quot;

and &quot;The Cat From Outer Space&quot;

Whether you liked any of these projects or not

all of them were highly original and different

unlike the tripe being force-fed to fandom today

The new

original documentary on the second disc is very

very informative

and included there are all the deleted scenes (I at long last found out whatever happened to that cop who crashed his car

)

the &quot;Special Edition&quot; extra scenes

trailers

and an original featurette from 1977

Interviews include Spielberg

Douglas Trumbull

Richard Dreyfuss

Teri Garr

Melinda Dillon

Bob Balaban

composer John Williams

the actor who played the child Barry (Cary Guffey)

and others

Also

it's funny to see a young

beardless Spielberg

This DVD version of the film keeps some of the Special Edition extra scenes added after the film was originally released in 1977

and the result is the best of both worlds

The film clearly states that

although the unknown may be frightening at first

we may not really have anything to fear

Best of all

we wisely do not follow Neary into the ship
