This review is for the blu ray and all I can say is wow

I just watched it and was thoroughly entertained throughout

I don't know if this will matter in any way to anyone but I'll state it anyway just in case it does

My equipment consists of an OPPO BDP-95 connected to a professionally calibrated Panasonic TC-P65ZT60 via an HDMI cable and a surround sound system made up of Paradigm Studio 100s V

4 mains

a CC690 V

4 center channel

Bose surrounds and an SVS SB13-Ultra subwoofer

The speakers are powered by an Emotiva XPA 2 and an XPA 3 for a total of 1200 watts

For a movie of it's age

looked spectacular to me

Very film like and it truly felt like I was at the theater

The picture quality isn't absolutely perfect by today's blu ray standards but it looks beautiful nonetheless and really draws you in which is all one can ask

During more than a few scenes I really couldn't help but notice just how lush colors and detail were

The sound was good too but not quite as good as the picture in my opinion although there was some serious LFE

Some of the black levels in this movie astounded me also with their depth

strength

clarity and shadow detail

I'm sure others know of even better movies with awesome blacks but this one has to be up there

I genuinely had fun watching this movie which is something that doesn't happen often enough with what Hollywood is pumping out these days

Good fun

Enjoy
