I believe the use of a deaf woman is symbolism for women who are vulnerable & who do not really hear what they are hearing from men

She's symbolic also for any women who have been made to feel less-than by society for any physical reasons

or from any emotional/spiritual abuse from family or previous relationships

resulting in them being vulnerable to manipulation

The first 20 minutes or so

is slow & rough

but then it gets funny (to me) and then it gets twisted

so I suggest sticking with it

It's a good learning lesson for a movie

These people do exist and they aren't all men

The female counterpart to this movie is \"The Shape of Things\" also from the talented Neil LaBute

who has been recently involved with Hell On Wheels

a great show on AMC

I will be waiting to see what new work Mr

LaBute sends us
