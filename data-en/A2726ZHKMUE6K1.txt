I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done

is doing and will do in my life

Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books

I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading

I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible

This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies

true to the Bible
