Two alpha-male business men on a business trip

Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy)

set out to destroy a deaf woman

Christine (Stacy Edwards)

by getting her to fall in love with them and then dumping her

in order to get revenge on women in general

\"In the Company of Men\" is possibly one of the most mean-spirited and misanthropic movies that I have ever seen (I say misanthropic rather than misogynistic

since

although many of the characters in the film are misogynists

the one major female character in this film

Christine

is presented as a nice person who does not deserve to be tormented by the likes of Chad

while the male characters are presented as being complete jerks)

As a result

it is not a film to be enjoyed (although I did laugh

in spite of myself

at a number of places throughout the film)

but it is a fascinating and totally believable study of the cruelty that human beings are capable of

It is made all the more effective and frightening by the fact that this cruelty is executed in a bloodless (and legal) manner

If Chad and Howard were torturing people in a manner like the killer in the \"Saw\" movies

I could tell myself that none of this is real and that most people aren't capable of such actions

but when the weapons of torture are words rather than knives

the idea of people like this existing in the real world becomes all the more plausible

Worse still is the fact that

even while \"torturing\" Christine

Chad still manages to come across as being charming and attractive

which is how he can succeed in the first place

This movie was the film debut of playwright Neil LaBute

Although the script of this film was written as an original screenplay

LaBute's stage background is clearly evident in it

and the film has a very stagy feel to it

This is the main thing I didn't like about this movie

On the other hand

Aaron Eckhart

in his first cinematic starring role

is absolutely brilliant as a conscienceless sociopath

It is Eckhart who makes this film

and from this movie

it is easy to see why he went on to bigger and better things

See this film along with \"Thank You For Smoking\" and marvel at the brilliance of Eckhart
