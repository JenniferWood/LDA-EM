Nicolas Cage either shines completely or sometimes gets cast into dismal characters and roles

I personally like less the \"Gone In 60 Seconds\" tough guy side of his roles and extremely appreciate his soft tender side; roles like \"Family Man\" and this movie

\"Guarding Tess\"

This is an endearing role of the dynamics between two individuals

Tess [Shirley McClaine - former President's wife] and her retirement secret service detail - headed by Cage

Like I was taught about flying - its usually 99% boredom followed by moments of sheer terror - their detail that guards Tess has the same dynamic

Always on guard - to walk the dog or get her lunch

etc









The point in the story where danger is immenent is a vital part of the plot - but in a sense it's almost anti-climatic in comparison to the wonderful bantering that exists between Cage and the former First Lady

The points where the current President gets his calls from Tess if Cage doesn't behave - are to me the funniest parts of the film

Great movie - a classic that I would rate with the likes of \"The African Queen\"

\"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" or \"The Old Man & The Sea\"

This is a keeper that I almost had forgotten existed
