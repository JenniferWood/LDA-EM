I'm 27 years old and I remember the first time I saw this show on HBO

I always enjoyed Jim Hensons muppets and Fraggle Rock

Emmet Otters Jug-Band Christmas is as good as any show shown during this time of year

LOL





I like the River Bottom Nightmare Band





lol Anyway

I caught it this year for the first time since i was a kid and the feeling is still there
