\"Les Miserables\"

the popular musical and play that has entertained many since its premiere in London back in 1985

But \"Les Miserables\" (which translates to \"The Wretched\" or \"The Poor Ones\") goes back even further

More than 100 years into the past

when it was first written by Victor Hugo as a French historical fiction novel in 1862

Considered as one of the greatest novels of the 19th century

the film has been entertaining generation after generation from its first film (\"Victor Hugo et les principaux personnages des mis&eacute;rables\") back in 1897 courtesy of the Lumiere Brothers and countless adaptations since

But its first big budget film adaptation was in 1998 courtesy of a film directed by Billie August (\"House of the Spirits\"

\"Pelle the Conqueror\") and a screenplay by Rafael Yglesias (\"Fearless\"

\"From Hell\") which was loosely based on Hugo's popular novel

As the film adaptation was similar to Hugo's novel

some characters who had a more prominent role in the book were removed entirely or their presence lessened in the film version as the primary focus is on the character of Jean Valjean

In December 2012

a new British film for \"Les Miserables\" was released in theaters

but where this version of the film was a musical

the 1998 film was not

And now

the 1998 version of the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment

VIDEO:\"Les Miserables\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1)

Part of me was wondering if this film would look soft and how the clarity would look compared to the original DVD release

And I was quite pleased with how the film loo
