About my only complaint about this film is that at least on the DVD

the sound is way too low





I had my home theater cranked on maximum volume and still could barely hear the dialogue

Maybe the VHS version would be better

This film would make my list of required viewing for students entering their first year of college

esp

those who are considering corporate careers

esp

for freshmen who are considering joining a fraternity

This movie lays bare the white-male/frat-boy cum corporate-slimeball/political-animal mentality perfectly and mercilessly

People

this film is NOT about a sadism or misogyny





if anything

it's a scathing expose of a certain TYPE of maleness: the kind of rubber-faced

snake-in-the-grass

self-absorbed and compulsive megalomaniac that the Aaron Eckhart character

Chad

represents

THESE are the guys who lurk and dominate the real corridors of power in the business and political world





for whome the term \"men\" in the film's title is ironic at best

LaBute strips away the glorified mask of these so-called \"alpha males\" to expose the true scum underneath

And not only the \"alphas

\" but their \"beta\" groupies too

as symbolized by the Howard character---an otherwise pathetic conformist who first idolizes

then tries to emulate Chad only to end up getting crushed by him at the end

And that's what the film is really all about: the compulsive and self-absorbed male megalomania that only truly reveals itself during the stunning last 10 minutes of the film

That's where we finally see that this film is not about what some men do to some WOMEN

it's really about what some men do to other MEN
