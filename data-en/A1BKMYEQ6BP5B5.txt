Really

I am stunned

This goes right next to that danged whale movie as a How in the World Are People Finding This an Empowering Story

I was led to believe it was about women playing baseball

No

It was about women who'd rather be doing something else playing baseball

about sibling rivalry

and a big public service announcement that looks are really important and that fat people are subhumans that deserve to be punished

The only character that undergoes any growth is (surprise







) a guy

Tom Hanks as the alcoholic manager who overcomes it when he has Something to live for

Rosie O'Donnell

the one athlete in the bunch

is a one-note as the fat person we are allowed to make fun of

Madonna is the one-note that

well

ya gotta have a designated slut if you have a bunch of women together

The dialog really gave Madonna enough to work with that she could have brought more to the character

but she chose not to

I am baffled that O'Donnell cooperated in her own pillorying

And really

what's with calling her ugly

anyway

I'm a het woman and if I looked in the mirror only to see Rosie O'Donnell

that would be fine

Oh

I know what's wrong--she's not skinny

Got it

We are expected to be appalled at the fake newsreels where the women ball players are made to put on lipstick and powder their shiny noses

and we are not allowed to notice that this film displays the same silly

dehumanizing emphasis on looks over substance

In the bus scene

the little boy is made to terrorize the team members until he gets chocolate

He is

of course

a hefty kid--just in case we hadn't noticed yet that fat is bad

and that women are to blame

the mom gets the kid to stop his tantrum with a treat

If this movie addressed how women really behave in groups

there would be a scene or two with someone trying to find the little boy something to do during the stupifying bus ride

But you see

we can't have women with real emotions in movies

There can be no real drive--only competition between individuals

There can be nothing nurturing or generous--unless it is of the passive

subservient kind

such as Geena Davis's character throwing the game

What a horrible film
