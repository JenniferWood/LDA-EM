This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen

but I've given it five stars for a reason that could not have been known by the film makers in 1988

The minute of film time when Seth Green arrives to take Alyson Hannigan out on a date is one of the funniest things I have ever seen

something which will be backed up by any Buffy fan

The level of coolness that they have now is off the scale

and seeing them both as geeky fourteen year olds (Seth with red hair

and Alyson nearly a foot taller than him)

is worth the price of this movie alone
