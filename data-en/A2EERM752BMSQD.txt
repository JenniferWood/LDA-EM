Some good nostalgic stuff here

considering they showed this over and over and over on HBO back in the early days

Saw this more times than I can count

and then a gap of about twenty years happened since I've seen it again recently

I forgot how good it looked

how fun it was

But I also forgot about how visible those strings are

Haha





not that it mattered

it's all in fun and fantasy

I must admit

there was a lot more singing in this than I remembered

My brother and I always thought the Riverbottom Nightmare Band DID win the competition - I mean

that song they performed was COOL

Still

this was a trip down memory lane for me

If you have seen it already

you know how fun this little show is

There's a ton of singing though

I found it more fun when I was younger

but being older

I found it more annoying this time around

Maybe I've lost my taste for musicals

Anyway

I've heard of the cuts - and yeah

they don't make sense

The DVD itself is bare bones

but the video image is sharp and clean and impressive
