As a professional puppeteer myself

I can look at this production a bit differently than other viewers

I am sometimes critical of the manipulation and content of some Muppet productions

but Emmet Otter is one of the finest puppet creations by the Muppets or any other puppeteer I know

It departs for what can be called &quot;Muppet cute&quot; and

except for some brief sections of the talent show that are more typical Muppet

is a beautiful film

The music could not be better

the voice are perfection and the manipulation flawless

Normally the Muppets use hand

rod and mouth puppets

but there are sections of this production that also use marionettes (string puppets)

Whenever there are long shots of the characters walking or skating on the ice

these are the marionettes

Everything about the production is of exceptional quality

There are wonderfully &quot;quiet&quot; sections that are delightful and add a lot to the tone of the story

The story is one of the most uplifting and delightful of all the Christmas specials

It is a tape that can be watched over and over at any time of year

The message that love is the most important thing should not be confined to just one season

I have had my copy of &quot;Emmet Otter&quot; since it first came out on a Disney release so am not aware of any editing

However

I have given copies of the newer version to friends and they have all loved it

so unless you are a puriest

enjoy one of the BEST holiday productions ever
