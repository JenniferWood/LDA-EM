Excellent

IF one can relish in parallels of strange father - son relationships

An interesting amplification of many (not typical) strong/stern fathers to diligent sons

I am doubtful it will be enjoyed by the masses

I would rate it a very well done

very offbeat

study of (a-typical) Fathers and Sons

I watch it occasionally and draw parallels to my life vis a vis my father
