I didn't get past the first twenty minutes of the film

For some reason

they decided to focus on the bad guy instead of the good guy - a huge mistake

Without a protagonist to focus on

I got impatient waiting for the real movie to start

to get away from this nasty guy

but that never happens

It is all about him

The so-called good guy takes a backseat

while we get to watch the anti-Christ working his evil

The scenes are choppy

losely strung together - no unity or coherence at all

They look deceptively professional

as far as the picture quality goes

and the acting is professional

Maybe the rest of the movie gets better

but in my opinion

if they can't get it right in the first twenty minutes

the movie just isn't worth watching
