Although just under an hour

the 1998 A&E; Biography special on Anne Frank does a wonderful job of exploring her life and the positive effects her diary has had on the world

Interviews include a 1979 clip from Anne's father Otto

Miep Gies

and childhood friends Hanneli Goslar and Jaqueline van Maarsen

Helmuth \"Hello\" Silberberg

a good friend of Anne's shortly before the Franks went into hiding

also shares his memories of the girl

His brief but interesting clip is reason enough to check this out

It's not said on the special

but Hello and his family were liberated in Belgium the very same day the members of the Secret Annex were shipped from Westerbork to Auschwitz

How tragic is that

Hannah recalls her short reunion with her friend over a Bergen Belsen fence and Anne's miserable

lonely death of typhus (just a few day after her sister Margot's) is sobering

to say the least

However

her legacy continues when a Broadway play about her life in hiding opens to rave reviews in 1955 and a film adaptation follows a few years later

Unfortunately

both take her famous line \"I still believe

in spite of everything

that people are truly good at heart\" out of context in order to paint her as a saint

Many of the interviewed subjects point out that Anne was a creature of her moods like the rest of us

She constantly wrestled with her feelings about war and mankind

but she was loved because she was a regular girl like all the other girls

Except that she had an extraordinary talent for writing

For a more detailed portrait of Anne

I'd recommend the documentary Anne Frank Remembered

But this is one isn't a bad place to start
