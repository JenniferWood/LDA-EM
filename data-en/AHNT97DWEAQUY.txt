I had forgotten how good this movie was until I got it on DVD

Richard Dreyfuss puts in a great performance as Roy Neary

His portrayal of the subtle changes his character goes through throughout the movie

from child like enthusiasm

to outright obsession

is spot on

Francois Truffaut also puts in an outstanding performance

This is the movie that established Spielberg's kind of &quot;awe/woundrous&quot; style of filmaking

You know

like the spaceships in Close Encounters

E

T



Indiana Jones' adventures

the first glimpse of a dinosaur in the Jurassic series

he just stages some wonderfull awe inspiring scenes

I really like how this movie is made

It's not so much about the aliens as it is about the people

namely Roy

who they touch somehow

How these people become obsessed with UFOs or whatever

As for the UFOs themselves

Speilberg teases us with small sighting near the beginning of the film

a tense scene at the house of the little boy

and some finds of missing planes and ships

Other than those few scenes

it's more about the characters and you don't really see much about the aliens until the big pay off scene at the end

And as for that scene

it's worth the buildup

Even 20 some odd years after the movie came out

with the advancement of special effects and everyting

the climax still manages to be awe inspiring

The extras are great as well

Some really good deleted scenes here

about 11 in all

some dealing with the chaos of Roy doing his work when the power goes out

some dealing with Roy's obsession with the sky and the infamous inside the spaceship ending that was in the Special Edition

I also really like the scene with the policemen filing their reports

A couple of old trailers for the movie

it's interesting to see how they advertised their movies back in the day

And my favorite

the in depth documentary

This baby is as long as a movie by itself and it has tons of info on the movie

everying you wanna know

I love it when a disc goes all out on a documentary

as I find the behind the scenes stuff

the stories to be told and the looking back on stuff intriguing

This movie whets my appetite for Spielberg DVDs for now

much like Jurassic Park and Jaws did when they came out

But like those movies

it won't be long before I crave MORE Spielberg on DVD

Bring on E

T



bring on Indy

bring on Shindlers List

bring 'em all on
