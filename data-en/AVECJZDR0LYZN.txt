This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid

Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens &#8220;Christmas Carol&#8221;

this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit

I love the regular story of Christmas Carol

but this is refreshingly different and a must see
