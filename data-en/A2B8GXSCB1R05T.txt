When Godzilla reared his angry head again

Toho studios wanted something good to take him on

Winging her way in from her own premier movie

Mothra is just what is needed to put the big guy down

\"Godzilla vs

Mothra\" (\"Mosura tai Gojira\" or \"Mothra vs

Godzilla\" in Japanese

) is a great sequel in the first series of Godzilla flicks

After the overly-campy \"Godzilla vs

King Kong

\" Toho studios took a back-to-basics approach with the mighty lizard

designing a new

more menacing suit and allowing him to rampage over such familiar landmarks as Nagoya Castle

This new suit is famous amongst Godzilla fans

and was unfortunately damaged during production

Crossing over from the film \"Mothra

\" Emi and Yumi Ito

the Fairy Twin's known as the Shobijin

come to Japan to attempt to reclaim Mothra's egg which was dislodged by a typhoon

Profit-minded executives see money in the colossal egg

and refuse to return it

Godzilla arrives

Mothra arrives

Giant monster battle ensues

This DVD

however

is a terrible presentation of a good film

There is no original language track

which should be absolutely shameful when presenting a non-English movie

Also

the US release is altered from the Japanese original

including extra scenes of a \"Frontier Missile\" that were filmed at the request of the American studios

who felt it was patriotic
