Steven Spielberg's original masterpiece analyzed the UFO phenomenon and produced an emotional meeting between humans and aliens

But that is the original version not the sanitized special edition

If Steven Spielberg is such a great filmmaker

than why did he recut the original

He destroyed the emotional ending by inserting Richard Dreyfuss hyperventilating as he enters the mothership

And he suspiciously removed the scene which accused the government of covering up their knowledge of UFO's and how people are looked upon as crazy for their beliefs

So

Mr

Spielberg continues to censor his original masterpiece

Why

I have rated the original

Please search it out

Incredible photography

fantastic performances

and dramatic special effects combine with Steven Spielberg's pastiche of UFO events to create one of the finest science fiction films of our time
