the blu-ray print of this film is TERRIBLE

no better than the older DVD copy i have owned for years

i really don't think a film of this age is worthy of a blu-ray release unless the film has undergone a digital restoration specifically for the blu-ray print

the sound is wonderful but the picture is very grainy and not crisp at all

why waste your time and my money on releasing a new DVD that is no better than the old version
