This boxed set is very nice; it contains several DVDs

a booklet

and a fold out chart

Each DVD contains a different version of the movie

and the Chart describes the changes (additions or edits) in each version of the film

I thoroughly enjoyed this film

and I recommend the Director's cut

Watching this sort of thing andThe X-Files: The Ultimate Collectionmakes me feel better about real experiences

Watching some other poor bastard go through it is much better

For those of you who live in the city

get away from the light pollution for a while

You'll appreciate this special edition boxed set even more

Regardless

this movie set is fantastic

and the special effects are terrific

I had never seen the movie

until I purchased this set

Recently

I enjoyed the film

and I recommend this edition
