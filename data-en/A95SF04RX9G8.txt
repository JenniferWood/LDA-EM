Corporate America is full of jerks corrupted by power who feel that they have every right to use this power to their own advantage and treat others like garbage

In the Company of Men tells the story of a few such gentlemen

and does so in what is supposed to be a realistic way

but I have a hard time believing that the characters here are acting realistically

A pair of men go on a six-week business stint out of town

working on an anonymous project for an anonymous large company

Chad (Aaron Eckhart) encourages Howard (Matt Malloy) to play a \"game\" with him while they are on this business trip

He proposes that they find a vulnerable girl and each begin dating her and treating her kindly

then at the end of the six weeks

pull the rug out from underneath her and bask in her agony

The purpose here being that in the future

when either of the two of them feels mistreated by a woman

they can look back on this and tell themselves at least it's not as bad as that

Howard isn't overly enthusiastic about the idea

but goes along with anyway

The pawn ends up being a secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards)

who also happens to be deaf

Chad takes her out first

then Howard does the same

Things start to get complicated when Christine starts to develop feelings for Chad

but Howard starts to develop true feelings for Christine

and isn't sure he wants to be involved in this game anymore

Meanwhile

everything is going according to plan for Chad

and he is loving it

I think one of the points that this movie is trying to convey is that the most ruthless

heartless

sadistic individuals are able to succeed in business because they don't care who they step over while they're on their way up

Chad certainly fits that bill; he is absolutely despicable

almost to the point where he is a caricature

and it ultimately makes his character difficult to believe

There is virtually no way to sympathize with his character and that's because he's one-dimensional: he's a jerk and we should loathe him

and we do

The whole game just doesn't seem like it would ever happen

Why would a man like Howard go along with it

He seems much too smart and compassionate to agree to this heartless plan

When watching the film

though

I put aside my disbelief of the premise and found it to be pretty good

I liked the way director Neil LaBute allowed for long takes and really let the actors do their thing

and they did a very good job

especially Matt Malloy

However

it's difficult to make a film realistic when you can't believe the situation
