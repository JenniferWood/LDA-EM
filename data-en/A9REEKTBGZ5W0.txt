I've loved Emmet Otter since I was little

and now this video has become a Christmas tradition for my family

I do miss Ma telling Mrs

Fox to fall off the dock

and I don't care for how they show more acts at the talent contest

But most everything I really love about this movie is still here

The songs are so catchy and fun

and we have them all memorized

The characters' voices are so gentle (aside from the Riverbottom Nightmare Band)

But most importantly

the story teaches little ones about the true meaning of Christmas and giving

This movie definately isn't just for kids

and I highly recommend it
