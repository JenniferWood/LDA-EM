I originally bought the first edition DVD from Blockbuster (back when they were still around) But when I went to watch for the first time

it wouldn't play

I Bought this 2 disc special edition (used) from FYE and it played with no problems

I had fun watching it while I was recovering from a wisdom teeth extraction

This is another one of my favorite sports movies along with \"42\"

\"Rookie of the Year\"

\"Major League\"

\"Field of Dreams\"

\"The Sandlot\" etc

It is a movie that I will treasure for years to come

Update for 3/10/14 I also bought this DVD as a gift for my mom's best friend who hasen't seen this movie in a long time and I know that she will really enjoy it
