Only Jim Hinson could use such charming hand puppets to tell his story so that children (and adults) can understand the meaning of love for our fellow man

All the little otter freinds in Frog Hollow tell us a charming story of love and devotion

The original music and songs are easy for \"our little otter pals\" to sing

The magic in Hinson's story is one we can all remember for many years to come

It doesn't matter if the version is the original which was produced in the 1970's or this new version

the meaning that Hinson wanted to tell comes through in every frame of the film
