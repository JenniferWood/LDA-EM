Godzilla vs

Mothra (actually

Mosura tai Gojira [ Mothra vs

Godzilla]) is the best of the golden age of kaiju eiga (Japanese giant monster movies)

It came on the heels of King Kong vs

Godzilla

which

although commericially succesful

was a flawed if entertaining effort

Godzilla vs

Mothra features sprawling

beautiful special effects

an engrossing story and likable characters

Director Inshiro Honda and SFX Director Eiji Tsuburaya

the artistic legends behind the Godzilla legend

are in top form

The score of Maestro Akira Ifukube drives this great spectacle with thundering

memorable themes as well the beautiful themes and songs associated with Mothra

the strangely beautiful giant insect who somehow manages to fight Godzilla to a standstill

Godzilla vs

Mothra is not only a classic

indeed the greatest sequel of the Godzilla series

but one of the greatest science fiction films ever made

If you want to see the best of the Godzilla series after the 1954 original

Gojira

then see this wonderful epic where all of the hallmarks of kaiju film making are on such grand display: the great kaiju (monster) designs (in fact

many fans of the series consider this Godzilla design

called the Mosu-Goji

the best design of them all)

the expressive suit acting

the detailed miniatures

stunning visuals and meaniful but entertaining storytelling

Godzilla vs

Mothra is a wonderful chapter in the world of kaiju eiga (Japanese Giant Monster movies)

Treat yourself to this great adventure
