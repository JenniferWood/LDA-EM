To me

this is the best movie to come out of Disney's dry spell of the '70's (when it released such stinkers as &quot;Million Dollar Duck&quot; and &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot;)



terrific fun for the whole family

Edward Herrmann (who I normally find an unbearably annoying actor) is quite good as a pastor who finds himself fighting organized crime when one of his church members gambles away church money

(True

he should be angry at the church member

but our reverend believes in tackling the ROOT of the problem)

After Herrmann speaks out against organized crime publicly

two FBI agents come to him and ask him for his help in going undercover to expose these gangsters

He asks for help from his congregation

and the only ones who will aid him are 6 indomitable females (Patsy Kelly

Virginia Capers

Barbara Harris

Cloris Leachman

Karen Valentine

and - later - Susan Clark)

You'll relish every second that you see all of the ladies on the screen

especially the scatterbrained soccer mom Harris (her funniest scene takes place in a grocery store

as she spies on one of the pickup men); the constantly-primping Leachman; and tough-as-nails Capers

Features a cute cameo by Ruth Buzzi as part of a church committee out to remove Herrmann (she ends up joining the ladies to fight the criminals)

Unfortunately

I find that the film suffers when nervous Fed Michael Constantine leaves the project in the Reverend's hands; his exasperated scenes with the ladies are among the most enjoyable in the film

Another small drawback is the cutesy way in which the movie treats organized crime



you'll never believe for a second the gangsters are really out to hurt these ladies

The film's final moments

a &quot;demolition derby&quot; of sorts

will delight kids

I can remember absolutely loving this film as a kid



I'm positive one day Disney will remake it (hopefully they do it justice)
