Overall

I enjoyed this movie

espescially its ending

The casting was great (Okay fine

Josephs former master was a white woman

so what

She played her part well I thought)

Sexually explicit scenes

Give me a break

There were no sexually explicit scenes

There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife

This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily

and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt

I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please

you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear

\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie

but gave it dimension

I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary

Besides one or two minor thin
