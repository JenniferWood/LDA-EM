&quot;Godzilla vs

Mothra&quot; is probably my all-time favorite Godzilla movie

mostly because it has better-than-average special effects and an ecological angle to the storyline--don't exploit the environment

or there will be dire consequences--that still resonates today

This DVD reissue

though

is woeful

especially in comparison to the Simitar DVD put out a few years ago

That DVD gave viewers the option of widescreen and fullscreen images

though it was light on extras

This reissue from Sony only offers the fullscreen version

and a scratchy print of it at that

And the extras

Nothing but a commercial for the &quot;destroy All Monsters&quot; video game

Go find a copy of the Simitar DVD instead and avoid this one unless

like me

you're fond of wasting money
