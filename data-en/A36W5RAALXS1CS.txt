Mothra vs

Godzilla features one of Godzilla's finest screen appearances

with human drama and spectacular monster action coming together to create a near-flawless daikaiju picture

Classic Media presents an excellent DVD release

with both the original Japanese version and the 1964 American International Pictures release (under the original A

I

P

title Godzilla vs

the Thing)

This film is one of the few Toho monster fests whose American release version surpasses the original

This Toho classic depicts Godzilla at his all-time best

featuring one of the most impressive Godzilla suit designs and some of Eiji Tsuburaya's finest special effects work

Virtually every scene featuring Godzilla was composed to be visually spectacular

and the innovative effects work holds up admirably

even after 40+ years

Akira Ifukube composed a memorable score

which perfectly complements the film and establishes motifs that have become synonymous with Godzilla over the years

While the original Japanese version contains a few minor scenes that aren't present in the American release

it is missing one of the best-realized effects sequences shot for the film--the Frontier missile attack scene

Most likely

this is because the attack is carried out by the U

S

Navy

which

at the time

would have flown in the face of Japanese sensibilities

The Classic Media DVD is superb

although the aspect ratio of the U

S

version is cropped to be narrower than the original widescreen (due to it otherwise being the best available print

I understand)

It's a small issue

so this DVD release receives top recommendation
