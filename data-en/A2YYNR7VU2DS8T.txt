I am not a sci-fi fan

At all

But i just saw \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" on DVD and I loved it

Maybe not Spielberg's finest (\"Schindler's List\" takes the cake)

it's definitely one of his best

The setting is rural Indiana

Our main character is one Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss)

a struggling electrician who is contacted by aliens and travels to Devil's Tower to meet them

Accompanying Roy is a distraught mother (Melinda Dillon)

whose little son was \"kidnapped\" by the aliens

But also heading to Devil's Tower is a band of government researchers led by a French scientist named Lacombe (Francious Traffaut)

In all

this is an amazing movie

Filled with great acting and mind-blowing special effects

\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" is truly a masterpiece

And a magical John Williams score only makes it better
