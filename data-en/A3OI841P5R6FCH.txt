`Lean On Me' has become one of my favorite inspirational movies involving real people and events

despite the simplified and sometimes sappy-sickly-sweet Hollywood `feel-good' treatment it's been given

along with a happy ending that ties everything up a bit too neat and nice

The forces trying to stop Joe Clark's straightforward efforts to turn Eastside High School around has been simplified for the movie

basically involving just a disgruntled parent and the city mayor

Even the many heated arguments between Clark and his faculty &amp; superiors are less than sophisticated in wording and tone

None the less

I've always loved Morgan Freeman's performance of Clark

Clark's expulsion of the most delinquent students was a pretty neat scene

and was something of a surprise when I first saw it

Anyone who'd attempt that nowadays would probably get sued penniless

And the rooftop scene where he tells expelled crackhead student Thomas Sams to just jump off the roof of the school and kill himself swiftly rather than slowly by smoking crack is one of my fave film moments

and the best 'tough love' moment in movie history: \"It kills your brain cells

son

it kills your brain cells

\"And as the school improves

Clark does as well

In the movie you see him learning and adapting alongside the students &amp; faculty

Even with his best efforts

he discovers that can't turn things around by himself

At first

his gruff behavior and strongarm approaches to solving problems makes most of the teachers reluctant to help him out

But they learn to adapt to Clark

and he learns to soften his methods a bit

and even gains a sense of humor

Sadly

the real Joe Clark

to a small degree

has `gone Hollywood'

His big gig nowadays is working the lecture circuit

as a motivational speaker

He's even written a book about what to do to save America's public schools

I've heard some of his speeches

and found them rather compelling

but I feel his talents and drive are best suited for running a school in need of a decisive

no-nonsense leader who gets things done
