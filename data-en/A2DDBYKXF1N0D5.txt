I've got to admit that this one never sounded appealing to me - a giant moth

a giant &#34;ester&#34; egg

twin girls the size of a soda can - &#34;I mean

come on&#34;

I always thought

But after my boss

who's a huge Godzilla fan

recommended this one to me

and after seeing other fans' reaction to it

I decided to give it a try





and I'm so glad I did

I loved it

Although the first film in the series will always be my favorite

I think this one was a pretty damn good one

True it is a bit silly at times

but it also has a real serious human story in it too

There's a lot of talk about the dangers and our misusage of nuclear weapons; I like how the people of Mothra island dislike and despise man for destroying and polluting their beautiful land and how the real villains throughout most of this film are greedy businessmen rather than Godzilla himself

For something so silly

it has a lot of deep adult themes in it that just made me love it

and without a doubt is why this film is so popular

As for the monster fight scenes themselves

they are beautifully staged and exciting as hell

This was also the last film in the original Godzilla series that has Godzilla himself portrayed as the bad guy

In all following films he is portrayed as the good guy

at least until the rebooted &#34;Godzilla 1985 (AKA: The Return of Godzilla)&#34;

This is a great film that has things in it for kids and adults

and for all monster fans in general

If you like monster films

then I highly recommend this one because it would be a shame not to have this in your home video collection

Highly Recommended
