\"Lean on Me\" is one entertaining movie

and Morgan Freeman is sensational in it

In fact

if he hadn't made another movie that year called \"Driving Miss Daisy

\" he probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination for this

That said

I have to say the film has gotten the traditional Hollywood biographical treatment

which is to say credibility and plot coherence take a backseat to uplifting entertainment

The final score: for entertainment value

give \"Lean on Me\" *****; however

it only ranks a * on the credibility scale

The plot has been regurgitated enough by previous reviewers

and several of the more honest reviews have been incisive and accurate in pointing out the flaws in the plot

I

too

had a hard time with the chaining and locking of the school doors; this act is such a flagrant violation of the fire code it is laughable and puts the safety of hundreds of students at risk

Also

the speech Clark gives where he blames the faculty for the failure of the students (in front of the student body

no less) is offensive and disrespectful and totally ignores a more important problem altogether: the total unwillingness of many parents to take responsibility for their failings as parents and for the acts of their children

And I truly doubt Clark could get by with expelling three hundred students and face the wrath of a small group of angry parents led by what can only be described as a cruel stereotype: the loud-mouthed

trouble-making

liberal-minded

white and authority-hating ghetto mother

played by the late

wonderful character actress Lynne Thigpen

(Even she struggles with this dreadful role

) And the entire student body rallying to Clark's defense when his irresponsible actions finally catch up with him

Laughable

to say the least

But I have to disagree with the reviewer who characterized the story as a \"liberalization\" of what really happened

If anything

Clark's tough-love approach to running the school is extremely conservative in nature

and many of his educational tactics are reminiscent of G

W

Bush's \"No Child Left Behind\" educational programs

which is the main reason Thigpen and the other parents fight him as hard as they do

But as I said up front

the film is definitely entertaining if it isn't taken too seriously

Director John G

Avildsen approaches the material in the typical crowd-pleasing

underdogs-win-in-the-end-so-let's-have-a-good-cry manner

which is effective until fifteen minutes after the film is over and you kick yourself in the butt for being manipulated

And the supporting cast is stellar

including Robert Guillaume

Beverly Todd (as the beleagured vice principle) and Michael Beach

And the wonderful Regina King has a touching two-scene cameo as a depressed

unemployed mother who no longer feels worthy of her daughter's love

But this is Freeman's show and his incredible performance dominates the proceedings

No matter how ridiculous his actions

no matter how over-the-top his character travels

(picking up a baseball bat and declaring to the press: \"They call me \"Crazy Joe\" now they can call me Batman

\") he makes Clark believable and manages to pull back and reflect on his own shortcomings and accept criticism at just the right time to keep the character from becoming a total egomaniac

He is sensational

and \"Lean on Me\" was one of several consecutive films (including \"Street Smart

\" \"Clean and Sober

\" \"Driving Miss Daisy

\" and \"Glory\") in the late '80's that made him one of the most unlikely superstars in cinema history

Believe me

you'll love \"Lean on Me

\" Just don't be surprised if you end up hating yourself for it
