Without a doubt not only the best made Godzilla film of the old series butone of the greatest giant monster films foreign or domestic

After a violentstorm a huge egg appears floating off Japan's Karada beach where its quicklybrought to shore and put in a huge incubator for public exploitation

All ofthose involved soon find out that this lost egg belongs to the god of infantisland \"Mothra\" and must be returned as told by the two tiny representatives(the Peanut sisters) but their cries fall short of the greedy opportuntistThings become worse when Godzilla appears (and not in the best of moods)WithJapan (and American) weapons unable to stop this Titan

The only hope now isthat of Mothra but will the natives of infant island be reluctant to help those who refused them

This sets the stage for a truly great scifi/Fantasy tale as only Toho could weave

Great on so many levels this was one of the few serious Godzilla entriesof the series and it shows in the care of it's production From the pacingof the film's story to Eji's Special Effects (Godzilla never looked moremenacing) to Akira's greatest score ever

I never get tired of watchingthis film one of my favorite moments other then the titled bout itself is Godzilla's first weary & confused appearance as he slowly stomps his waytoward Japan's more populated areas (I always thought of this the aftereffect of his fight with King Kong from \"King Kong vs

Godzilla\" but thatis probably just me

)The Newly Released version by Classic Media is the best restored versionyet whether your watching the Original Japanese Version or the AmericanDubbed version you love the clean up The Japan version is in 2

31 formatwhile the American Version is formatted to fit 16x9 Televisions

Extrafeatures are in the form of a well meaning tribute to Music Master AkiraIfukube and a poster slide show with an Original Japanese Trailer

I lookforward to sampling future attractive thin cased Media classics
