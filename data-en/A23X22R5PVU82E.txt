The problem with the film is that it tends to be superficial and it is difficult to get a sense of the sweep of the novel

Perhaps that is impossible given the scope of Hugo' vast canvas

But one would have wished for a greater attempt to adhere to the structure of the novel as written

As far as I am concerned there is no satisfactory film of the great work
