Without a doubt

one of Spielberg's best

A clean

well-written movie that blows away most alien contact flicks

Science Fiction done with respect and love for the genre

Unfortunately

there are so many versions of this film floating around that you'd better just wait and see what they do with the DVD

I for one hated the &quot;Special Edition&quot; and am just as unimpressed with the Director's Cut

There are still scenes missing that need to be restored (including the '77 ending)

and only DVD can do the special effects and soundtrack justice
