This is a classic movie

one of my all time favorites

It was great on VHS and DVD

but I must say the HD transfer is FANTASTIC

As others have stated there are a few areas where there is some grain

but hardly noticeable if your into the movie

The collectors set with packaging is worth the FULL ASKING PRICE; It comes with three versions of the movie and Special Features on a two Blu-ray Disk (BD) set

Disk 1 has: The Original Theatrical Version

Special Edition

and the Directors Cut

All in 1080p High Def and with English DTS HD 5

1 or Dolby Digital TrueHD 5

1

Disk 2 has the Special Features

It also comes with a 30th anniversary collectors book that has information on the actors/actresses and other details of the movie

All in all

I would have paid more for this collectors edition

it's a true value

Highly recommended

go BLU
