The acting was pretty good but Madonna was suggestive and exposed herself

as she always does

Rosie is not loveable any more she has too big of a mouth off screen

The rest of the actors were pretty good

Tom Hanks in this role was just okay becuz he was such a slob

It showed a true picture of the way women were treated as second class citizens during the 40's

at the least ruled by their husbands
