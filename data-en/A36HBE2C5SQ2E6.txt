Penny Marshall's film about the first women league during the course of World War II

brought the women out of the kitchen and onto the baseball diamond to play and amuse the people while the boys are fighting overseas

At first

the league is ridiculed and made fun of

but some star players really bring in the crowds and show that indeed girls can play baseball

The Rockford Peaches

a team of consisting of a vixen

a former Miss Georgia

and two sisters that have a intense rivalry that consists of the younger sister being constantly in the bigger sister's shadow as the teams star catcher

With a deadbeat

washed out

former baseball player as their manager

The team forms a bond that isn't broken over the course of years

When they go to the playoffs

the sisters rivalry comes to a head as the sisters have to prove who is the better baseball player

Penny Marshall simply has made a marvelous film that combines emotion

drama

and comedy effectively

She can take a actor and make them have some fine acting done

She effectively makes the characters seem real and realistic

She doesn't make the characters seem fake and wooden

She adds dignity and emotion to the ball players and adds a sense where we see the ball players as women

She also can feeling strange and wonderful when the movie is over because you have experienced the women as both ballplayers and humans

Tom Hanks gives one of his most unique performances to date

He proves that he has the staying power and the guts to take a character and add his own characteristics to it

He is a marvolous character actor

Geena Davis was a solid actress

Her performance was probably one of the best of her career

She really has the acting chops

Madonna was very imperessive in her role

and she hasn't amazed me lately in her roles

But

she really pulled out a solid performance in this film

Penny Marshall really proved that she is one of Hollywood's best female directors

Like I said

She adds a certian diginity to her characters and makes them human

She has a soft side and it shows in her movies

The film is a solid look at a league that was ridculed and it rised above the chains and formed some solid all american players

I have to say

very impressive

Ms

Marshall
