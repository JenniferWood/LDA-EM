CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of Spielberg's most personal films

and one of his best DVDs

Originally released in 1977

Spielberg re-released it with additional footage in 1980

then altered it again for the film's 1997 re-release on VHS with the extra footage dropped and some scenes never released put back in

This DVD is the definitive version of Spielberg's classic

with the extra sections making the film's progress more involving than when it was first released

Extra stuff aside

does the film itself deserve a place in the collection of all-time great Science Fiction

The answer is a resounding yes

as the film conveys a sense of excitement

wonder and obsession

Different from other nihlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies)

Close Encounters is a story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss)

who

after having an encounter with a U

F

O

starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film's conclusion

Dreyfuss

who also starred in Spielberg's own Jaws (1975)

is brilliant in this film

with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film

which has become an undisputed classic

While perhaps not as essential as the 2 Disc version with lots of extras

CE3K is an impressive film in any format
