Its got more laughs

more excitement

more moxy

more talent

and more heart than any other baseball film

And it tells an important true story

The writing is superb

the directing (Penny Marshall) is top notch

and the same can be said of all the actors

Standouts include Tom Hanks

Geena Davis

Rosie O'Donnell

Madonna

Jon Lovitz

etc

--even the ugly girl and the fat kid are outstanding

I especially loved the wise-cracking dialog by Lovitz and Hanks (\"I loved you in the Wizard of Oz\") and the sensitivity between Davis and Hanks

And I may be wrong but this is probably the best work O'Donnell and Madonna ever did on film --both are naturals here and Marshall highlights their respective strengths

The Oregon sisters thing goes on bit too long

but that's a small matter when the rest of the film is so enjoyable on all levels
