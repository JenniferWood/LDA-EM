I 'member seein' this as a kid in Etobicoke (Toronto

Kannader) - my Dad was a missionary

so the plot was of particular poignance





He never took on the Mob

but it was fun to see that church life could be so

uh

jocular

Me'n my siblings'n folks all had a good time

and there were no 'embarrassing' moments (for me back then) in the movie where somebody was kissing

or hugging or doing anything 'intimate' that you just don't DO





particularly onscreen - Lorr-dee
