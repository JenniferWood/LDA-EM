This DVD is available

but only from Classic Media's website

I believe they have made the decision to distribute this and Godzilla Raids Again only thru thier site

Watching this on my HD TV and using an upconverting player

both versions of the movie look very good

Perfect

No and I do wish they had taken the effort to clean the prints up (esp the American version)

A great bonus is he audio commentary

It's very interesting and informative

Lots of back story info and a couple of short interviews to boot

Very nice cover and packaging

the included the Japanese trailer as an extra

A nice addition to my collection
