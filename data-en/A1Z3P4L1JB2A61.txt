I hadn't heard of Guarding Tess until i found it in my parents movie collection

I was maybe eleven at the time and only picked it out because it had my nickname

Tess

in the title

Since then i have become a N

Cage lover

So i brought the movie because i forgot what it was about

(i just remember i liked it)

The only reason why i say this is because by reading the other reviews

it hasnt been teens buying this movie which is a shame

You could really feel Cages emotions through the screen and Cages and Maclaine has a relationship that was pleasant to watch since you don't really see that kind of loyality anymore

And how couldn't you love the ridiculously bossy widow who everyone is afraid to say no too

Which is always a great element of a good comedy
