I came across this masterpiece by accident

but from the start of the film I was thoroughly engrossed in what turned out to be a classic film about human nature

More movies of this ilk should be made

as it was entertaining

while being completely believable

This is a movie that I will purchase and watch over and over again

Bravo to the directors and actors

who made this little-known film so superb

Although this movie contains some violence

it certainly is appropriate for teenagers
