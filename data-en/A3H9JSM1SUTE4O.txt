Steven Spielberg's epic film that brainwashed the world into accepting alien invaders with open arms and a five-note melody arrives in a great looking two disc set that includes a fascinating new 102 minute \"making-of\" documentary and 10 deleted scenes

The lush 137 minute widescreen transfer is apparently the third version of the film and is Spielberg's definitive version

For now

Rated PG
