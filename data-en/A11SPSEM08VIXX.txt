This film is the most unique work Spielberg ever produced on his own

While Spielberg has produced many great films this one stands alone as his true best

He was clearly in the zone when he did this

This ultimate Blu-ray set is the last version you will ever need

Unless Spielberg comes to my home and talks with me during the screenings this is the last version I ever plan to own of this film
