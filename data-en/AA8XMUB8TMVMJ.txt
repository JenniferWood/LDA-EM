Worth watching this new version of the classic

It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining

The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old

It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old

Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man

The wig was very good though--looked very authentic
