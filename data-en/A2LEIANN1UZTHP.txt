One can't help but think that the purpose of this movie was to answer a film project homework requirement in college

The town didn't have anything to do with the movie

was just the destination

Kinda over-the-top

to use the town's name for the movie's theme

It only manages to be preachy

I think maybe they were trying to do a character study

of how bonding with one's kidnapper works

or other such philosophical angles

The acting is okay

maybe even good

casting is okay

and they do work as a team/ensemble; but the script is mediocre at best

Maybe on purpose

to show that crime isn't at all fun

Maybe that's why big-name stars like Rod Steiger and Martin Sheen signed on for bit parts

But it comes off as a movie you'd show to high school students to teach them why crime doesn't pay

A little too heavy with that message; pacing was not good

We shouldn't make movies that glamorize crime

to be sure; but we don't need to make them so boring

that the message isn't learned
