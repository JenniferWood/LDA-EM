I love this movie

I know it by heart

and yet I cry and laugh my way through it each time I watch it

Bravo to Tom Hanks

Gena Davis

Rosie O'Donnell and even Madonna - this movie is first rate

After seeing this for the first time

I went to the baseball hall of fame and was moved walking through the women in baseball section - See this movie

own it

and watch it over and over again



You'll find something new each time
