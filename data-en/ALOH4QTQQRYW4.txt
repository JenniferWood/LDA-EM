The leads are very good in this version

Rush and Neeson especially

The biggest problem for me was that Eponine was cut completely

I didn't like the way they did the Javert suicide scene either

Just doing the Nestea fall into the river with Valjean just standing and watching was weak

Overall

a decent film and worth watching
