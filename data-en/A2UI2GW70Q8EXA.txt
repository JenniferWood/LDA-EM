A League of their Own was one of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure to see

I had seen it years ago and recently bought my own copy of it

This movie is one of the best that Penny Marshall has ever directed

The casting was superb

Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell were perfect as street-wise

but loveable May and Doris

Geena Davis did a wonderful job playing Dottie Henson

who had a genuine love for the game

yet had responsibilities and priorities that were more important to her

Lori Petty was great as Kit

Dottie's little sister who fought so hard to get out from under her sister's shadow

Marla Hooch

what a great character



Evelyn and her little boy Stillwell &quot;Angel&quot; will keep you in smiling all the time you want to bean him with a baseball bat

Ellen Sue

Helen

Betty Spaghetti

I feel like I know them all



And Tom Hanks plays one of his best roles ever

as Jimmy Duggan

an ex-ball player turned coach

Not too thrilled with the job of coaching &quot;girls&quot;

he accepts the job and finally comes to respect them as a team and as baseball players

I think one of the best parts of the movies is when the ball players reunite after 40 years and the casting of the older woman to play the parts of the aging ball players is a masterpiece

It is remarkable how these older &quot;look-alikes&quot; were all brought into this movie

This is a movie worth watching

owning and recommending

Very few come along in a lifetime that provide so much good

positive entertainment

but this movie has it all

I recommend it highly
