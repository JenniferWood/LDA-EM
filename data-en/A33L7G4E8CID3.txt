Spielberg's alien masterpiece about aliens invading Earth was an instant classic in the seventies

and is still a great film

better than Star Wars

Why

Because we can identify more with a middle-aged electrician than we can with a moisture farmer on a desert planet

Richard Dreyfuss is the aforementioned electrician

who has an extraterrestrial experience and suddenly is obsessed with these aliens

This epic is an excellent early work of Stephen and truly delights the senses as well as the mind

and is still extremely watchable today

Now

for the faults

It starts slow and never really builds to a frantic pace

but it only increases the suspense

Although the aliens are a little disappointing (just the basic pointy-eyed

almond faced stereotypes)

these faults are easily compensated in this amazing experience

One of the best sci-fi movies of all time
