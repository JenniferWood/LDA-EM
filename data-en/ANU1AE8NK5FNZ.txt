I love this movie

but I need to mention one thing

Right in the beginning

Morgan Freeman is have a challenge between the boys and girls in class

and asking them questions on law

He asks

&#34;What is the origin of our civil rights

&#34; One boy says

&#34;The Magna Carta

&#34; Wrong

A girl says

&#34;English Common Law

&#34; and puts the girls ahead with her &#34;correct&#34; answer

But the answer is incorrect

Why

Our charter

The Declaration of Independence

states that all men are created equal

and are endowed BY THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights

and that among those rights are life

liberty

and the pursuit of happiness

So

rights don't come from man's law

and they don't come from the Magna Carta

or even from the Constitution

Rights come from God

So

when you are challenged

don't say

&#34;My Constitutional rights

&#34; but say

&#34;My God-given

Constitutionally-protected rights

&#34; That said

please watch this movie
