This is just a great story with a lot of important lessons about the way things work in this world

It isn't easy to triumph in the worst of conditions

but it can be done

Sometimes doing the right thing isn't easy or popular

and sometimes (perversely) it might not even be legal

Morgan Freeman is excellent in the lead role

and the supporting cast deserves a lot of praise as well

I don't know how well the movie matches the actual events

but the end result was a great story that I thoroughly enjoyed watching
