I may be the lone hold out

but







on my Samsung DLP

the transfer is terrible

I am of the opinion that the HD transfer is also enhancing the grain of a thirty year old movie

The DNIe engine in my Samsung is making that grain more enhanced

Any family scenes in the house look like they're in a snow storm

Other than that the outdoor scenes are great

and the colors and sound are awesome

If you have a Samsung DLP

though

you will have to watch it with the DNIe off

The picture is not as sharp

but the snow is not as bad

By the way

I looked at the regular DVD version in the same Blu- Ray player and there was a little grain

but no snow





with the DNIe engaged

32 dollars wasted

Hard to say at this point

Anybody else having this problem
