This baseball movie set in the middle of WWII

is excellent

and my granddaughters watch it over and over

Since my granddaughters are avid softball players this true story video about a woman's baseball league helps promots woman sports in a very realistic way

Highly recommended for any baseball coillection and for viewing by all girl ball teams

they will love it
