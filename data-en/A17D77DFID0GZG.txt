Look

Van Damme films will never be in a class that I consider good fare

His stuff is usually thin on plot

full of laughable dialogue

and fist-thick on martial arts

Does that mean that I don't watch his stuff

No it doesn't

I've watched his movies because there are times that I don't want to think

just escape

and he provides just that in \"Maximum Risk\"

Out of his movies that I have seen

this one turned out to be one of his best

if not the best (but honestly

he doesn't give us a lot to choose from)

\"Maximum Risk\" is an extremely violent movie with a very high body count

I lost track of the dead early on

While the plot is as thin as always (Russian mafia

twin brother

beautiful girl)

Ringo Lam pumps it up with some nifty car chases (if you like that sort of thing) and provides the viewer with one heck of a ride as we step over the bodies

This is non-stop action from the get-go

and the fight scenes (yes

there are many) are hard-hitting and brutal

yet believable (almost a first)

For those that like Van Damme

this movie should be high on your list

For the rest of us

well

it is violent and even mean-spirited

but I ended up enjoying the ride

and the credit must go to director Lam

Between 1 and 10

\"Maximum Risk\" gets a solid 6
