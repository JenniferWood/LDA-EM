Marking the third time this film has been released

legitimately

on DVD in the United States

Classic Media delivers the best presentation of the movie to date on region 1

and arguably their best offering yet

There are still some problems with the video presentation though

generating a mixed effort between the Japanese and US versions of the film

but with a good audio and extra presentation for the disc this is certainly one of their more solid releases to date

After a shaky video presentation on Classic Media's Godzilla Raids Again

the company gives a much more satisfying transfer for one of Godzilla's best regarded films

In fact

the quality on the Japanese version is only slightly shy of being fantastic

as it displays a nice array of colors while print damage is almost nonexistent as grain is also kept to a minimum

The problems

though

include the brightness level being adjusted too high

washing out some details in the process

and the fact that the movie is overly soft looking

lacking a great depth in detail

Consequently

I would imagine the softness in the image is due to compression

as both versions of the movie are sandwiched on the same disc

although at least other overt signs

like shimmering

never rear their ugly head

The movie's Toho Scope aspect ratio (2

35:1) is also maintained for this release

while the disc is also anamorphic for widescreen sets

Now

also included with this disc is the original AIP release of the movie dubbed into English

and complete with the original \"Godzilla vs

the Thing\" title card

As is well documented

the US version of the movie is also being presented in a cropped 1:78:1 aspect ratio as their source material for this was superior to the original Toho Scope print they had for the US version

My response to that claim

though

is simply that the other source must have been god awful then

as the quality is severally lacking here

especially in contrast to the excellent Japanese source Classic Media managed to get

To elaborate

the coloring is off here

the degree of which varies through the course of the movie (looking fairly good during the climax at least)

while the print used also displays a lot of damage including tons of scratches and a thick layer of grain

Granted

since the AIP version is so highly regarded

as I will admit it's my favorite \"Americanization\" of a Godzilla movie

it's still nice that this was included regardless of quality

However

it's disappointing that the transfer here isn't more up to snuff

and it also makes one wonder what happened to the print Simitar used for their Godzilla versus Mothra DVD

as minus the heavy compression displayed that print appeared to be in decent shape

Mothra vs

Godzilla boasts two mono audio tracks

one being in Japanese and the other dubbed into English with each tied to their respective version of the film

In terms of the audio quality

there are no complaints to be had

Some more options in the audio presentation would have certainly been nice

but this presentation does stay true to their original formats and there are no notable discrepancies between the two

The Japanese version can be accompanied with

removable

English subtitles

Not the best assortment of supplemental material

but one can't complain much about the selection on this disc

First up is a documentary on the life of famed composer Akira Ifukube done by Ed Godziszewski

Sadly

Godziszewski is a little dry in his reading here

but the information and depth in his findings is superb

The short video ends with a lengthy written tribute by Toho's current president

Shogo Tomiyama

for the passing of Ifukube earlier this year

Next up is a short feature called the \"Poster Slide Show\"

which displays various posters and other promotional material used for the film during theatrical release

Because Mothra vs

Godzilla was re-released so many times

this short is much more satisfying than the one minute video located on Classic Media's Godzilla Raids Again DVD as there is a lot more material to cover

Thankfully this release also contains the movie's original Japanese theatrical trailer

with quality that is about on par with the disc's presentation of the Japanese version of the film

Last up on this disc is another commentary track for the US version done by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski

The commentary track on this DVD

though

is counter balance to the one Ryfle did for Godzilla Raids Again

as the pair gush about the film a lot in contrast to the riffing that was done of the 1955 movie in the earlier commentary

Of course given the praise this movie often receives and the notoriety of the second Godzilla film

some might not find this surprising at all

although the two tracks do present two very different styles of commentary presentation

To be subjective

the praise in some areas is laid on a little thick

but the information is outstanding and it is interesting to hear the two relate about how influential this production was for them

Bottom line

it wouldn't be fair to call this an amazing release

but it's one of the better region 1 Godzilla DVDs out there and I would say the most solid release from Classic Media to date

Hopefully the company hammers out a few of the problems found here for later titles as there is certainly promise for future offerings from them
