The film starts and we see UFOs flying above

Roy sees it up close

and becomes obsessed with finding out what is going

at the expense of his family who think he's gone crazy

He becomes friends with a women he met the night he saw the UFOs

who had her son abducted

They both have visions of a tower

that holds some sort of significance

When they see on TV that near Devils Tower in Wyoming

there has been an evacuation because of a toxic spill

they both realize this is the tower they have been seeing

They travel there

and find an awful lot of mysteries there

What is going on at this tower

that is calling these UFO witnesses there

as well as the military

This is one of Steven Spielbergs first films

and was very successful

At the time their was a lot of interest in UFOs in the mainstream

The special effects in this movie are stunning

and the UFOs look amazing

There is also a small romance undercurrent present

The film is open ended and has a lot to be interpreted

letting us use our imagination to build upon the story's conclusion

Kids and adults will enjoy this film

but there is some profanity

Any fan of science fiction absolutely needs to see this film

4 stars
