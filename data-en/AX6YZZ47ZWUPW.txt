the biblical symbols in this film are very striking

The clouds moving across the evening sky

the lights within the clouds

Remind the watcher of biblical appearances by god

The intense desire on the part of the characters to go to the source of these events

also points to biblical situations

The special effects are dazzling in my opinion

although I don't believe these events could have been kept secret for very long

in view of the number of people involved in them

The lighter scenes are quite humorous

especially the mash potatoes

This film in my opinion

was designed to make the viewer feel closer to his creator

and to dispell the idea that we are totally alone in the universe

A very good film

well worth purchasing
