I saw this movie when it first came out

and just finished watching it again on AIV

I have always been a huge fan of Shirley MacLaine

and she plays the fiesty Tess to perfection

And Cage

He too was totally believable as the much-put-upon Douglas

This flick is both funny

and warm

as we watch Tess & Doug first butt heads and then grow very close

Add a touch of who-done-it and this is a movie anyone can enjoy

I love this movie - gave me a huge \"heart smile

\"
