This film holds a special place for me

because it was the only film I've ever seen at its world premiere

in LA in '77

My only free film junket

too

back when I edited a weekly newspaper in Minneapolis

I still remember the party with Spielberg and Melinda Dillon and Terri Garr & the little boy

Anyway

a classic of sci fi

I think it shows its age

but it's still lotsa fun

One caveat

though

This DVD edition is dull and murky looking; doesn't do the film justice

I would get the Blu Ray instead

Gotta be better
