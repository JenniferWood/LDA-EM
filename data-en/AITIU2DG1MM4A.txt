This is a nice video overview of the life of Anne Frank produced by A&amp;E's Biography

The people at Biography almost always do a nice job and this episode is no exception

There's not a lot of detail but there are some nice interviews with people like Otto Frank and Miep Gies

Hearing their voices adds something for those who have only read of them

This is what I think is the true power of videos like this--it allows readers to put faces and voices to names

I think this video is also nice because is fills in the spaces around the period covered by Anne in her diary

particularly what happened after the Franks were arrested and Anne could no longer write

It is important for people who have only read the diary itself to become aware of these other events

On the other hand

no video (even the best of them--Anne Frank Remembered) can presently compete with the quality of written material out there

There are so many excellent books covering every segment of Anne's life that it would be a shame for someone who is truly interested in Anne to limit themselves to this video
