As an avid kaiju fan

I can give a certain amount of leeway to these movies

The often campy horror mixed in with rotten English dubbing is no longer a tough pill to swallow for me

Asinine plots with meandering writing roll right off my back when presented with a nice dose of Godzilla blowing up Japan

Yet \"Godzilla Versus Mothra

\" keeps such problems to a bare minimum

This movie needs to be viewed not simply by kaiju eiga fans

but by everyone

Its messages for humanity are still yet to be heeded

and as they say

\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it

\"The setting of \"Godzilla Versus Mothra

\" is Japan in 1964

Naturally

the effects of World War II were still being felt in Japan

with especially high tensions in regard to atomic weaponry

The story gets rolling when a giant egg washes ashore in Japan

prompting a news investigation

Unfortunately

before the investigation can truly get underway

a greedy entrepreneur snatches up the rights to the egg so that his boss and he can construct a theme park centered around it as its main attraction

Tensions increase between the news team and the wealthy exploitation masters when ridiculously small twin women from Monster Island demand that the egg be returned

Of course

money makes the world go round and nothing can be done to persuade the business men to relinquish the egg

Not even the timely appearance of Godzilla

Eventually

the news team goes to Monster Island

right off the coast of Japan

in order to plea for help against Godzilla

While reluctant at first

the denizens eventually agree to send Mothra to do battle with Godzilla

although such a deal only works as Mothra is eager to reclaim its egg

Mothra and Godzilla have an interesting relationship

No

it's not a sexual one

but their life stories are quite similar

Godzilla was born from the radiation of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of World War II

and Mothra was born from nuclear testing on Monster Island

This relationship seems to convey exactly the sides of good and evil: When dealing with unfortunate circumstance

will you aid people or will you destroy

Essentailly

thats what we're dealing with in terms of Mothra and Godzilla

Godzilla is the ultimate destroyer

and Mothra is the ultimate defender

Imagine things on a smaller scale

both idealogically and in terms of literal size

and you'll find a worthy comparison to our everyday life

Of course

there's also the typical Godzilla message of the dangers of atomic experimentation

Radiation does no good to the world as \"Godzilla Versus Mothra

\" tries despearately to convey

Buried beneath this

however

is an even more hopeful message of reincarnation and the generations to come: When Mothra first does battle with Godzilla

he fails to defeat the giant lizard and is killed

Mothra's egg hatches as a direct result of Mothra's death

as the twins explain earlier in the movie

Essentially

when Mothra dies he is reborn as the larvae from his egg

These larvae are eventually what defeat Godzilla

If you take things from a more theoritical perspective

\"Godzilla Versus Mothra

\" is conveying a hope for the younger generation to do away with the terrible power of atomic bombs

but such a hope can only be carried on through the knowledge of the older generation

\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it

\"Of course

the outer layer of this yolk is laden with delicious monster on monster action

Despite being made in the mid-1960's

\"Godzilla Versus Mothra

\" boasts some impressive fight sequences

Naturally

everything is absolutely basking in the thick cheese that is kaiju eiga

so such impressive fight sequences often involve a man in a rubber suit wildly stepping on toy tanks

Yet this cheese is to be expected

What isn't so expected are those deep

involving messages that manage to be delivered even admist poor English dubbing and a man in a giant lizard suit

My only real complaint with this movie is with the ridiculous inhabitants of Monster Island: Japanese people painted red adorned in stereotypical tribal gear

complete with cliche worship rituals

It's a shame that a movie that excels in every other facet as to sink so low during those points of the story

Still

glimpses of a cheesy story do not hinder Godzilla Versus Mothra from being perhaps the finest kaiju eiga ever created
