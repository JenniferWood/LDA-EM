As a person who has seen many productions for the film/play and listed to many version of the musical this version is one of the worst I have ever seen

The main thing that kills the move for me it the ending

It really doesn't finish and Jean Valjean would never cheer at the death of a person no matter what it might mean to him

Liam Neeson Acting is fine at time even great but it's not enough to save the film

Uma Thurman is ok as Fantine

but the one really saving grace to the film is Geoffrey Rush he does a great job as Javert

I think he give Anthony Perkins a run for the roll in the end

If you like the movie/show I would stay away from this one but if you are like me and wish to see all the versions out there then I guess you have to watch this one

but don't expect much from it
