In the farm of Oregon Dottie Henson and Kit Keller are working on the farm

Sisters that do love each other

except when it comes to baseball

Kit wants to play in the league but is upset to hear that it is Dottie who is chosen to play for the AAPGL

(All American Pro Girls League) Dottie refuses to play unless Kit can come along

AAPGL was only made because of the World War II and all of the man were in the war

Along the way to the stadium they meet Marla Hooch who is a great hitter

but to most people not the prettiest girl

When they are going to try out they meet Doris and Mae because Doris threw a baseball at Dottie who caught it impressing Doris

They girls find out their new manager is Jimmy Dugan

Jimmy Dugan drinks a lot and is the worst manager until Dottie get through to him and he becomes a better person

Miss Cuthbert makes sure the rules are followed

no boys

no drinking or smoking until Mae poisons her meal

The girls go to party and Marla who had been overlooked a lot is noticed by a guy named Nelson

Dottie's husband Bob is in the army and when news comes that a man in the army has been killed it turns out to be Betty Spaghetti

After awhile

Kit feels that once again like at home she is behind Dottie's shadow

Dottie notices it to and asks to be transferred to another team

Of course Mr

Lovitz doesn't want the best player to be transferred so he has Kit transferred to Racine

Kit feels that Dottie did this on purpose

Kit plays for the Racine while Dottie plays for Rockford

In the final scene Dottie is crashed into by Kit and she drops the ball

letting Racine win

making Kit have her own stardom instead of being in Dottie's shadow

The girls have a reunion and they remember the fun they had together

Stylish

warm and fun to watch
