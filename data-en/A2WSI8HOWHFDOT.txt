some people might need a box of tissues handy

\"A League of Their Own\" is not a sad movie--far from it--but it has its nostalgic zings at the end

as well as a couple of heartbreaking moments

Yes

this is a movie about baseball

and it succeeds at that level--just read the other 300+ reviews

But it is also a movie about the struggles American women went through during WWII: the shortage of eligible men; husbands dead

dying or maimed overseas; the challenges of being taken seriously; manipulative employers and owners

etc

(And

once the war was over

things would not get better for many of these women

as they would be pushed out of the spotlight and into some suburban

kitchen-appliance-filled

anonymous Eisenhower-era home

Although this is not depicted

we know their fates

)The film is shot fairly conventionally

which I thought was appropriate

Penny Marshall allowed her very talented cast to take the ball and run with it

so to speak

(I know

baseball not football

) Hanks and Davis spar each other nicely

The Madonna/O'Donnell sideshow has a lot of appeal

For my money

though

Lori Petty gave a much-needed electrical charge to the screen

She is the most vulnerable

most frustrated character in the film

There are some nice extras here but some were throwaways

I liked the \"Nine Memorable Innings\" documentary--I

especially liked what Geena Davis had to say

Some of the edited scenes were good

other scenes deservedly wound up on the cutting room floor

I could have done without the Madonna video--not one of her best songs or videos

All in all

though

this \"A League of Their Own\" set is a great addition to any movie lover's (or baseball lover's) collection
