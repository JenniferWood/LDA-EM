I had these three DVD

this one Joseph and David and Abraham for a long time

I believe it was in the late 1990

s and I got them on VHS and then I donated them to a nursing home because I knew they would really enjoy them

And then I brought them on DVD

So I have enjoyed this movies for a long time

I also got Abraham on VHS and I gave it away and brought it on DVD

All were excellent
