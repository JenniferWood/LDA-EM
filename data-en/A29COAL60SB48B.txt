Peggy Sue Got Married is one of Francis Coppola's better projects and I came away from the film wishing I had lived through the 1960's

The big question is \"what if\" we could go back in time and have a chance to make our decisions over again

Would we choose to do things the same way or differently

Even though Peggy Sue wants to change things

she finds that she can't (or is unable to) but getting a second perspective on her relationship with her then-boyfriend changes how she views her marriage at the end of the film

While I wasn't born until the late-1970's

I constantly heard stories when I was a kid about the close-knit feeling of families and neighborhoods back then

I can't envision being able to live in a house where you didn't have to lock your front door at night

although that's what I keep hearing from Baby Boomers (and even what's left of older people) to this day

It's cool catching this movie on TV

It gives people my age (and younger) a glimpse into how things were \"back in the day\" when being into your family (parents

grandparents

etc

) was a part of everyday life
