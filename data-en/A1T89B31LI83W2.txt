It's a good time to be a sci-fi fan

BetweenBlade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]

2001 - A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]

and this marvelous Close Encounters release

it's an embarrassment of riches

These are some of the best films in the genre

and they're all getting the treatment they deserve on the new high definition format

If you haven't seen the movie in any of its three versions (all of which are available here)

no plot summary can do it justice

It's worth a blind purchase based just on its pedigree (Spielberg

fresh off of Jaws

is at his creative peak) and reputation (8 Oscar noms

#64 on the AFI top 100

95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes)

If you need to know a little something before jumping in

it's the story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss) who

after witnessing a series of unexplained bright lights

becomes consumed by an obsession with UFOs that tears his family apart

At the same time

a multinational group of scientists investigating a series of mysterious events begin preparations for the first diplomatic visit from extraterrestrials

So the film is a classic

What about the disc

First

this is the only Blu-ray I've come across that doesn't have that cheesy blue plastic top

The packaging is a stylish cardboard slipcase with shiny metallic artwork of a bright light on the horizon

Along with the two discs

which I'll get to in a minute

are a book containing on-set photographs and biographies of the cast & crew

and a poster outlining the differences between the three versions of the film

These are the kind of paper inserts I wish more movies came with instead of worthless lists of chapter titles and ads for other movies

All told

this set looks very nice on the shelf

But how does it look on the screen

Great

Bright lights against a dark sky usually spell disaster for image quality

but everything looks as it should here

Sure

it's noRatatouille [Blu-ray]; there are a few instances when the colors look saturated

but unless you high exceedingly high demands I can't imagine having any complaints

It's certainly the best this film has ever looked

In case you couldn't tell (or are the type of person to skip to the end of a review to get the bottom line recommendation)

I highly recommend it
