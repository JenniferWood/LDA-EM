The flawed characters give this mysterious movie its brilliant flavor

A silent mother

a cold

unfeeling father and a son trying desperately to win their love and approval

The movie \"Character\" marches its viewing audience along a grief stricken

no thrills scenic route

The booming musical score gives the feeling of a quickening downhill death march where you know you must soon face the powerful enemy

to the death

But what if the enemy is you

It's a movie that captures your attention with a questionable circumstance

then whisks you along toward the climaxing conclusion that may hold the answers

It thrives on unfulfiilled ambitions

desires

loves and needs

The lead actors play their roles to perfection

but I must point out two of the supporting cast members who bring out the flavor of the story with their unique seasonings

Look for Lorna and De Gankelaar to add a few dashes of colorful spice to what might otherwise be a bland and tiresome stew

Though the main struggle appears to be between father and son

you can't help but see the struggles many characters have with themselves and their choices

I highly recommend this epic foreign language movie
