I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures

The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well

even Potiphar's wife

As for Potiphar himself

the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that

It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but

have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years

PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby
