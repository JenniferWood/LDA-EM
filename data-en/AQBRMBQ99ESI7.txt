This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection

It tells the story of Joseph

the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt

Joseph is the favored son of his father

a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers

It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed

In slavery

he is taken to Egypt

His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing

Through God's favor

and Joseph's steadfastness

he rises to a position of immense power

When his brothers come to him

seeking help

they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution

The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures

At first

it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over

The result is a good story done well
