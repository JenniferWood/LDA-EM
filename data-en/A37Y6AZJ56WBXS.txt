Great great great

As with many of the other titles in the Bible Collection

I've watched this film several times and the emotions I am left with after watching it never diminish

Another production that remains true to the historic account

this movie was casted brilliantly and told superbly

Before I ever read the story of Joseph in the Old Testament

I had watched this film

This movie did an excellent job of re-telling the story

Highly recommended
