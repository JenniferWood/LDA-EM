Owen

Anna

Dr

Crane

Owen's Dad and all the others too

After nearly 10 years Reckless (the original) still has all it's charm

wit and really great individual developed characters to provide a really fun time

The sequel comes with it as a throw in so no reason to complain

The great bottle neck guitar soundtrack is great too

Just get it

The DVD has all the pieces other reviews talk about missing from the VHS tape versions
