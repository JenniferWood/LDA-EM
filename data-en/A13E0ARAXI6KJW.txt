This brutalizing 1997 character study of the misogyny among competitive males still stings with its spot-on accuracy of the corporate male psyche

With an obviously limited budget

this first-time feature from writer/director Neil LaBute really turns its characters inside out with a visceral potency that could not have been attempted by the major studios

The plot focuses on two middle management types

Chad and Howard

who are on a six-week project in the company's Midwest branch office

On the surface

Chad is a smooth-talking braggadocio who after breaking up with his girlfriend

claims to be fed up with the neediness of women

But underneath is a dark sociopath who is unfathomably cruel to anyone in his path

Watch the scene where he makes a black co-worker pull down his pants to prove he has the \"balls\" for a higher profile assignment

Having just been dumped by his fianc&eacute;e

Howard seems like the more benign of the two and looks toward the cynical Chad for guidance at the office and with women

However

his insecurities reveal an innately pathetic figure who wants to be able to exert power over someone defenseless

Realizing their mutual bitterness toward women

the two decide to make a disreputable pact to romance the same woman during their business trip only to dump her at the end

Enter Christine

a pretty office secretary who happens to be deaf

You can figure out the rest

but the way LaBute relentlessly reveals the characters' weaknesses

including Christine's

is piercingly honest to the point of painful

Even the twist at the end is well-justified

as LaBute's perceptive script makes the situation hauntingly cathartic

In his first important role

Aaron Eckhardt

with his square jaw and cocksure manner

is superb as Chad

and it took him several years (probably until his heart-of-gold Hell's Angel in \"Erin Brockovich\") to recover from this impermeable persona

In fact

he tweaks it as the unapologetic tobacco lobbyist in this year's \"Thank You for Smoking\"

As Howard

Matt Malloy certainly makes a most convincing dweeb

while Stacy Edwards (who is not deaf) elicits the right emotions with Christine

obviously the only sympathetic role in the movie

The DVD has two commentary tracks - the first with LaBute

Eckhardt and the crew

and the second with the three principals and again with Eckhardt

Both are quite insightful with the latter particularly entertaining for the contrast between the actors and the characters they play

Be forewarned that this is in no way a feel-good film

but it does make for seductive viewing
