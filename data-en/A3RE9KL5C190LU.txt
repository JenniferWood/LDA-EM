Second time I have seen this

Great storline and the actors were brillant in the movie

Tom Hanks and Geena Davis stole the show in this one

It appears Tom has played some baseball in the past as you can tell he was taking batting practice by himself and looked very fluid swinging the bat - unless Hollywood di that

Overall one of th ebest baseball classics
