Why is Geena Davis an Oscar-winner

Watch this flick; you won't need to ask that again

Her sensitive portrayal of Dottie Hinson highlights the many facets of Davis' talents as an actress

I loved watching a piece of history (however dramatized) which took place during my early childhood

Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell were surprisingly good as the loudmouth-but-secretly-caring-and-feeling Mae and Doris

You'll fall in love with Ann Cusack's &quot;Shirley Baker&quot;

and poor

homely but super-star batter Marla Hooch is someone you just gotta root for

Tom Hanks gives us his usual fine performance as the arrogant

boozy and cynical (but in for some surprises) coach Jimmy Dugan

The chauvinistic/sexist way the female players were treated (professional baseball in a cocktail waitress costume



) by management

the public and the press (&quot;





after all

they're only girls

&quot;) will incense many viewers

but it's the way things actually were then

For the movie to be made any other way would be less than truth

The way that the real Dotties

Kits

Maes

Dorises and the others dealt with those attitudes surely contributed to social change and enlightenment about the abilities of the female half of our population

A compliment

also

to the casting people; where did they find the older look-alikes

Notably

Lynn Cartwright as &quot;Older Dottie&quot; and Eugenia McLin as &quot;Older Ellen Sue&quot;

This movie is for everyone

Comedy with poignant drama

If you like teary endings

bring the Kleenex

The nostalgia scenes will start the flow

Great

great movie
