Why does everone like this movie

it's the worst Godzilla movie ever made

I makes no sense

an Indiana Jones rip-off & Godzilla gets teamed up on

Another stupied part was when Mothra and Battra were fighting

Mothra never used her laser beams when Battra was kicking here ASS

until Godzilla comes and fights Battra and only Battra

Mothra out of nowhere uses her laser beams

Heasi era ( I spelled it wrong) was a bad era for Godzilla why

most of them have bad plots

It's only worth watching once and never again
