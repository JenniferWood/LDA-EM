Pathetic injustice to a very creative classic is done by this video release

Even though it only lasted 3 seasons there has seldom been a sitcom to come along that so successfully satirized pop culture in such a believable manner

Real fans should start a letter writing campaign to whomever owns the release rights to WKRP and demand that it be released on DVD in its entirety as it aired originally

uncut
