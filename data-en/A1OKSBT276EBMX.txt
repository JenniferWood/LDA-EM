This is a very typical 30's lightweight

but fun movie

One interesting thing about the movie is the car featured in the film \"The Flying Wombat\" is the very famous Phantom Corsair

a one of a kind created by the very young Rust Heinz of the \"57 varieties\" family

The car can now be found at the Reno auto museum

Heinz was sadly killed in an auto accident (in another car) while promoting the Phantom Corsair

The car can be found on Google as well as in this delightful little movie

The scene in the auto showroom gives the illusion of multiple models of the \"wombat\" but there is only one
