When a film so knocks you off your feet everytime you watch it; when a film that is so sensually created and crafted with such magic as only the mastermind of Spielberg can create; when a film can evoke emotions in its watcher and choke them up

without trying to hide it in front of friends

family and the like; when a film can so catch the inner youth of angst when looking up into the nights sky and dreaming with every creative joint you can muster; when a film's cinematograhy can be so visually stunning and so imaginative

that you are completely in awe; that is when you can honestly sit around on some idle Sunday in May

and share the film again with people and everyone around you says they have goosebumps

and you know there is another reason to be alive

That is the way Close Encounters makes me feel; when I was 8

18 and 28

Spielberg has created such masterpieces that have shaped our lives

I thank him

I thank him
