Okay

so I'm an easy date if there's a scifi movie involved

although I was just 10 years old when this one hit theatres in Lubbock

A lot of movies from the late 1970s and early 1980s look pretty silly now

But Close Encounters stands the test of time

Now quit reading andpass me that big mountain of mashed 'taters
