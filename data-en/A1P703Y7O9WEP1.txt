If you've got the time to spare (and who didn't back in 1977

) then re-watching this old timer with a good picture is probably worth it

No commentary

but everything you would need to know is in the making of featurette

including tiredy looking Steven Spielberg on a Private Ryan set

He's a family man now

so he says he can't make movies about faithless men who leave their wives for a bunch of baloney

Why not

I suspect he may

like Lucas

be being put out to pasture soon
