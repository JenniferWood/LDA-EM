Magnificent acting

writing

directing

set design--the story is extremely compelling and the ending uplifting

It teaches many principles of virtue without in the least being preachy

There is much conflict

suspense

surprise

and believable twists in this absorbing drama

I watched it many times and learned many useful lessons from it

Buy it and enjoy it
