When I was six years old

I sat with my friend Kevin on his jungle-gym in his backyard at night and stared up at the sky

It was a very brisk evening with little humidity

and the light pollution from the nearby highway took only a small portion of the horizon out of view

It was the best night sky I've ever seen in suburbia in my conscious 25 years

We spent I don't know how long staring into space

but for some reason that night every blinking ball of light on an airplane or any other airborne object was to me a UFO

We began saying things like

\"Look at that one

That one

\" I believed for a long time afterwards that what I saw that one night were alien ships circling Earth

that we were not alone

and that it wouldn't be long before everyone else knew what I knew

Of course I was a tremendous fan of Sci-fi films like \"Last Starfighter\"

\"Explorers\"

the \"Star Wars\" films

TV shows like \"Transformers\" (later on in life a show called \"Space: Above and Beyond\" would get cancelled much to my disappointment)

I was the believing nerd; you couldn't convince me aliens weren't real

Everytime I watch \"Close Encounters\" I get that same chill I remember from being six

That sensation the actors have on screen when they look up at the sky and suddenly realize that there's more to watch for than just stars is real because I felt the same way that night

The plot is about a middle-age man Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) whose family life disintegrates after a close encounter of the second kind with an alien spacecraft as he's called out on a job late at night

Lost on the roads

he stops to check a map when suddenly blinding lights appear from above

No his truck doesn't go soaring up into a spaceship

no Neary doesn't get probed

instead his truck dies

there's a moment of anti-gravity

and Neary gets a nice sun-burn on one side of his face

UFO cliches die a happy death in this film

The aliens are neither aggressive

nor are they provoked into being aggressive

In fact

they are perfectly benevolent

if not partially enigmatic

Spielberg wanted to show a range of diversity amongst the aliens that would be parallel to humans

so you have short

stubby aliens

lanky

stick-figure aliens

and also more humanoid aliens that are expressive

Nowhere are there crop-circles

there are no long exegeses on their superior technology

no ray guns

no tractor beams or teleportations

Meeting the aliens is actually a highly organic experience; achieved with colors

musical themes

and staring one another face-to-face

In fact

nothing is really explained

it just happens and plays itself out

How are these people having visions of Devil's Tower in Wyoming

the exact coodinates of the alien visitation

How do they prepare the \"arena\" that's like a landing pad next to Devil's Tower

What's up with the alien technology

Do they have warp-drive capabilities

Do they have anti-matter containment units

Do they explore \"temporal disturbances\" like the crew of the Enterprise show after show

The questions are all moot

\"Close Encounters\" is just about the encounter

the experience

not about the calculator or the engineer

If you're looking for explorations of futuristic technology and the \"Cool





\" factor

apply somewhere else

This is somehow the reason why I come back to the night sky again and again

I've heard more than one backyard astronomer describe the night sky as a reliable

familiar friend

Herein lies the true form on \"Close Encounters

\" not that technology such as what the aliens possess exsists

or that we are enlightened by their coming

What gives form to the film's premise is the possibility that when we look up at the stars

those stars are looking back
