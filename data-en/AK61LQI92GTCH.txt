HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a curiosity

Telling the story of two pilots

one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin)

stranded on a small

deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat

Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors

Their plight on the island

coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy'

more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise

Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer

or are conquered by

our enemy

HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall

After a while

though

with all the attacks and counter-attacks

I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit

This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog

It was an ill-conceived scene

brutishly funny if the intent was humor

but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run

By the way

I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie

It's the right ending for the movie

and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one
