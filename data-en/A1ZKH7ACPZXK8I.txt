After the last three spectacular &quot;Hesei series&quot; entries

this one seemed a bit of a letdown

Don't get get me wrong

it is a fun movie

but it is more Mothra than Godzilla

The real conflict is between the two bugs Mothra and the ultra cool Battra

(It should've been Godzilla vs

Battra

)Godzilla seems to have nothing particular to do except get in the way of the battling bugs

Mothra is updated with new weapons and Battra is perhaps the most impressive foe since King Ghidorah

This isn't particularly one of Godzilla's best outings

but if you - like me - are a Godzilla fan

you'll love it
