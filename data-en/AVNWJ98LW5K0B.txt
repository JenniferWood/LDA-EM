well

i can't really rate the dvd

because its not out

but i can rate the film





this is a timeless classic that to me and my family has become synonymous with the weather getting cold







i can't remember a christmas without it





this is the Muppet retelling of &quot;the Gift of the Magi&quot; (which i learned later in life)

and with the genious of Jim Henson

another master graces this film - the music of paul Williams





paul williams has been a major influence to me





he also wrote the music for the Secret of Nimh

and some may recognize his voice as the 'Penguin' on the &quot;Batman Animated Series&quot;





he was recently homaged on an episode of &quot;Dexter's Laboratory&quot; as dexter's music teacher





the songs in Jugband Christmas are songs that will stay with you forever





&quot;Grandma's Bathing suit&quot;

&quot;Barbeque&quot;

&quot;aint no Hole in the Washtub&quot;

&quot;Brothers&quot; and my favorite &quot;When the river Meets the Sea&quot;





even if you never saw this film in the 70's or 80's

its never too late to discover it

maybe for your kids to discover it too





I own both versions of the VHS





the one with more music and less dialog

and the one with more dialog and less music





it will be interresting to see if on this DVD they do one extended version with all the dialog and all the music





I am also curious to see if the quality is restored at all





Either way

this is a movie to own
