I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS

It's now 11:30PM

and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago

Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances

The story was lightly funny at first

but didn't really go anywhere

The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange

and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation

it was still weird

The climax came at the end

and was very entertaining

for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot

There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life

I was touched by the movie

Thank you

I should go to bed now
