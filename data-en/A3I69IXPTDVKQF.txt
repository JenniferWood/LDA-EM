This one outdid my expectations by quite a bit

Alicia Silverstone stars as a teenage girl looking for more attention from her father

who tries to get it by locking herself in a car trunk and faking her own kidnapping

Her plans go somewhat awry when the car is stolen for real

The blueprint of this sounds like it could have gone sour very easily; the girl could have come off as very unlikable although that seemed much less of a probability with the charming Silverstone playing her

in full 'cute-and-feisty' mode

And while car thieves don't exactly rank high on my list of potential male leads for a romantic comedy

Benicio Del Toro somehow manages to pull off the trick of making the character likable as he tries to dig both himself and Emily (Silverstone's character) out of deeper and deeper - and more dangerous - trouble

The characters have real chemistry and click both comedically and romantically

and Christopher Walken excels as the character sent out by Emily's father to rescue her

One of the relatively few top-notch comedies to emerge from the second half of the 90s; highly recommended
