&quot;We are not alone

&quot; screamed the ads when &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was first released to theaters in 1977

After about 95 minutes of ponderous suburban angst

the viewer indeed discovered they had a friend or two in the skies

I was just a stupid kid when I first saw &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind

&quot; and I really didn't have the slightest clue what was going on

But oh how I loved the finale

a special effects-choked extravaganza which became one of the most famous scenes in cinema history

The seemingly endless buildup had some kind of payoff

and director Steven Spielberg's career was set for life (well

he did follow this film with the &quot;1941&quot; disaster)

The spring of 1978 for me was the season of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters

&quot; It was my first year of junior high school

My friends and I would debate if &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was the better film

Many said &quot;Star Wars

&quot; But for me

the film in history was &quot;Close Encounters

&quot;I still love Spielberg's epic UFO creation

It's a sort of quasi-religious experience for a kid raised on &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Invaders From Mars

&quot; In &quot;Close Encounters

&quot; the aliens were friendly and most shocking of all - we were nice to them

This had not been done before as the alien standard was usually a growling James Arness dressed as a murderous carrot

These days I still get a child-like thrill whenever I watch &quot;Close Encounters

&quot; The opening two thirds of the film are no longer ponderous

but identifiable

The awkward situations of a struggling middle-class family are realistically portrayed

Paul Schrader

noted screenplay author of &quot;Taxi Driver

&quot; wrote the original draft to this film

One suspects the obsessions and frustrations of Richard Dreyfuss' character came from his tortured pen

Richard Dreyfuss plays Roy Neary

working-class father and husband who witnesses what he believes to be a UFO

He finds himself tortured by visions and shapes seemingly stuck in his head

and he becomes obsessed with UFOs

Neary falls apart

losing his job

friends and eventually his family in several harrowing scenes

He befriends Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon)

a single mother who has witnessed these UFOs and is obsessed with similar visions

Her son is abducted by the aliens in a terrifying scene

They eventually realize these visions are mysteriously pointing them towards Devil's Tower in Wyoming

They frantically travel there even though the U

S

military claims a train wreck has caused deadly gas to cover the countryside

Scientist Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his eccentric team have devised a musical language enabling them to communicate with the UFOs

The meeting place is

of course

Devil's Tower in Wyoming

Neary and Guiler fight their way to the mountain

stumbling upon a government-constructed landing strip where Lacombe and his scientists hope to meet the aliens

An enormous mothership appears and humans make contact with aliens for the first time in history

This is not a simple story

and the drama which plays out between Neary and his wife (Teri Garr) is brilliant

Guiler's angst for her missing son is also perfectly portrayed by Dillon

one of the finest character actresses of this era

But the core of Close Encounters

the moment of truth

is the sequence involving the aliens

There are so many hundreds of ways this scene could have gone wrong

The aliens could have looked fake

but they didn't

The lighting could have been wrong

but it wasn't

The aliens are portrayed as being just as shy as we are - a perfect choice

There's a sense of wonder throughout the extraordinary proceedings

Eventually

one gets the feeling that if we truly meet brothers from another planet

it will happen much as it does in Close Encounters

If Walt Disney had decided to make a film for adults

it would have looked something like &quot;Close Encounters

&quot; Maybe Spielberg is the Walt Disney of the &quot;Easy Rider&quot; generation

And perhaps that is what &quot;Close Encounters&quot; eventually represents - a Baby Boomers' &quot;Peter Pan

&quot;
