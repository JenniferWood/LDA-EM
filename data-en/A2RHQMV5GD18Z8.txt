Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)Science Fiction

Drama

137 minutesDirected by Steven SpielbergStarring Richard Dreyfuss

Melinda Dillon and Teri GarrClose Encounters works so well because of the way Spielberg slowly increases the suspense

This is not a movie that relies on special effects; it succeeds because of a strong script and good acting

Although we learn of the alien presence at the start of the movie

most of the story consists of people's reactions to those early events

Why is Roy (Dreyfuss) behaving oddly and causing his wife and children to freak out

Chicken wire and mud in the living room is not normally a recipe for a good marriage

but it soon becomes clear why Roy thinks it's necessary

The idea is pretty simple

with an image being placed in the minds of selected people

Jillian (Dillon) has reasons of her own to pursue something and teams up quite believably with Roy

I like that there's no forced romance between the two and that they are merely acting on instinct

One refreshing thing about the movie is that the aliens aren't portrayed as invaders

There's no hostility in their actions

they just want to know and understand us

What a contrast to most science fiction movies up until that point

Spielberg keeps you interested for over two hours as two people journey across the country

That's quite an achievement

Notice too that the conclusion resists the temptation to show us too much about the aliens

Close Encounters is great cinema and has wide appeal to audiences of all ages
