Close Encounters Of The Third Kind was written when director Steven Spielberg was just out of his teens

It was a project very close and personal to him and after the box office success of Jaws (1975)

he was able to receive respect and creative freedom in Hollywood and was finally able to make his dream film as his follow up

Released in Novemeber of 1977

Close Encounters may be one of the best examples of Spielberg's great storytelling abilities ans sensibilities

I find this to be one of the most hopeful films I have ever seen

When the film opens

we are presented with an unsettling set up

we feel uncertain and even frightened and by the end of the film

we learn to have faith in our existence

The story is very simple

a ordinary family man sees a UFO and is planted a message

He then tries to put the pieces together and find what the message means

His wife and kids feel that he is losing his mind as he tries to figure out what his purpose is and why he was chosen

He senses that there is a location that is very important although he doesn't know why

he just knows that it means something

His family eventually leaves him and he is left to find the answer himself

He later discovers that a women he met earlier in the film received the same message and together they try to find the location and discover its purpose

It doesn't come easily though

it's a magical journey that ends with people learning to communicate and return to their inner child

You have to watch the film to understand what I mean

This movie was very moving in a decade that just didn't have many of those

The 70s were confusing times where we had lost faith in the world

When the film begins

we are scared that something isn't right

You get the sense (or at least I did) that we are lost and there is no communication or trust and at the end of the film we learn to see our world and ourselves through innocence and love

It is clearly a fantasy film but unlike Star Wars

which was released the same year

this film is more of a statement

It's a beautiful film about as I say

childhood innocence

I always walk away from this film with hope that maybe we can change and maybe one day

we will learn to fully understand our own self and eventually

our universe

One last thing

if you want to view this film

I would recommend the 1998 director's cut which I feel is the best version of this movie
