I had originally taped this presentation for home use

then somehow mislaid the tape

The DVD presentation is delightful

includes all 3 of the original episodes AND the Sequel

or 4th episode

I love bothRobson Green and Francesca Annis so am happy with this addition to my film library

I highly recommend it to all Masterpiece Theatre addicts like me
