I have always been fascinated by humming birds

In the 1980's I had the same house and feeder in the same place for four years

Over that time there were three hummingbirds who visited each year

They would watch me weed

fight a little but mostly they made me smile

This film is a jewel

The narrators soft accent is somewhat lilting

but in a positive way

It's a fascinating film and the cinematography was amazing
