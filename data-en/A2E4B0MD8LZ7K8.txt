Godzilla films have always had a reputation as being cheap

campy nonsense and are often treated poorly when released on DVD

At least when Classic Media released their new series of Godzilla DVDs they made an effort to treat these films with the respect they deserve but never got

To start off

Mothra vs

Godzilla is my favourite Godzilla movie

perhaps even better than the original

The special effects are pretty good (keep in mind the film was made in 1964)

the story is a fine example of how Toho monster movies of the time set themselves apart from their American counterparts and Akira Ifukube's score is

in my opinion

one of the greatest film scores ever written (up there with the Themes for Star Wars or Star Trek)The DVD

while much better than previous releases

has some strengths but also some flaws

It's greatest strength is the fact that it marks the first time the original

unedited

undubbed Japanese version was released in North America

The picture quality is pretty good and so is the audio

The subtitles could have been better: one scene the priest prays to the gods to protect the people from any \"courses\" (I'm sure they mean \"curses\") but that aside the Japanese version is very good

Unfortunately if feels like the Japanese version is the only feature Classic Media seems to care about

The edited U

S

version (Godzilla vs

the Thing) is in bad shape

full of scratches

hairs

grain and is cropped to 1

78:1 aspect ratio

After watching the Japanese version in its original 2

35:1 aspect ratio

watching this version felt like I was watching my old pan and scan VHS copy

The special features while decent

are somewhat slim

The audio commentary is pretty insightful into the making of the film and it's U

S

release

the Japanese trailer is also in as good a condition as the Japanese version of the film but for some strange reason they didn't add subtitles to it

so unless you can speak and read Japanese you won't understand what's being said or written on screen

Sadly they didn't bother adding the U

S

trailer as a special feature

Personally I think Classic Media thinks we'll just be happy to have the Japanese version of the film; and they're probably right

Overall

Mothra vs

Godzilla is a good film with a fair DVD release

It could have been better but it's probably the best were going to get
