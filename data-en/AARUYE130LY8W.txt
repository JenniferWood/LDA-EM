If you want the classic version

go with the George C

Scott or Patrick Stewart version

If you want the best family version

go with the Muppet Christmas Carol

which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good

But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new

effective setting

get this movie

As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's

Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance

The supporting cast

including Dorian Harewood

also turn in exceptional performances

Nothing in this movie is tacky

anachronistic

overacted

or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find

And if it leaves you completely untouched

let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special \"jump start\" this year

In short

this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season

I'm glad it's out on DVD

as we've worn out two videotapes of the show
