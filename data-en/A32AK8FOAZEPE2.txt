sometimes is a good thing

there are many people like these three people in real life everywhere

heartless

mindless

cruel

manipulating

demanding





there are people just like these men and woman we are meeting day to day

your boy friend or girl friend may be just like that kind of person

they use people by stabbing people in the back to crawl higher on the corporate ladder

hurting people mercilessly

don't view this film with your own personal morality standard if it too high

then i simply suggest that you ignore it

don't watch it

if you cannot watch something with an open-minded view

there actually has less stuff you could enjoy except those beautiful

pretty wallpapers on your pc screen
