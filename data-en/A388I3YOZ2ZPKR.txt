This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode

One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality

Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films

This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars
