This is without a doubt

among one of the best Baseball movies ever made (IMHO)

it's got a cast full of names:Tom HanksGeena DavisLori PettyMadonnaRosie O''DonnellGarry MarshallBill PullmanWhen the war kicks up in the Pacific and in Germany

Men's Baseball takes a hiatus so the owners of Baseball decide to initiate a woman's Baseball league











&#34;4 teams

16 girls to a team

that's 64 girls

&#34;Director Penny Marshall did a great job of casting older versions of the younger players' parts

especially Madonna's

Geena Davis's and Rosie O'Donnell's characters

She also did a tremendous job of putting the older actresses and actors in the Baseball Hall Of Fame at the end of the movie next to their younger selves

it just made for a very unique and emotional experience

The Baseball scenes were very well done and all the injuries that some of the actresses received in the film were real

including the slide into third by one of them who got this real ugly looking raspberry on her thigh and Rosie's bandage on her knee requiring several stitches

The movie was presented in widescreen and was crisp and clear in sound and picture

and contains several bonus features including Director and cast commentary

15 deleted scenes

&#34;Nine Memorable Innings&#34; Documentary and Madonna's &#34;This used to be my playground&#34; music video

This movie is a must have in any Baseball movie fan's collection

it's filled with laughs and I definitely recommend it
