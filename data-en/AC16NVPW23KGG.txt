I am glad Spielberg re-edited the film and included the scene where the ocean liner is found in the Gobi desert(this scene was originally dropped in the initial 1977 release)

There are also scenes that were dropped for the 1981 Special Edition release that are included here such as the Air Force press conference

and the footage of Dreyfuss tearing up his neighbors duck pond and yard to create his Devil's tower

One thing is missing however

and I think Speilberg made a mistake not to include the footage of Dreyfuss going inside the mothership on this version

Sound is incredible on DVD version

Special features include trailers

teasers

outtakes

and a cool documentary with interviews by cast and crew
