I think I am rating this a four simply due to its time and the technology that was available

not to mention that it is a timeless classic alien movie

This movie takes me back to my childhood and reminds me of a simpler time when I was a kid and this movie had some of the better technology

However

even back then I couldn't help but think that if this was such an advanced alien race why are they using our lighting technology--but I guess that's my opinion

With that aside it is still a classic and well worth watching
