Another twin movie

but without a twin

Yes

Van Damme gets killed at the beginning of the movie and his twin brother fills his shoes to find out why he died

Natasha Henstridge pays tribute to the immortal that is Van Damme and helps him deliver major risky business

Van Damme acts again for

the third time

It's a real exotic picture and it feels like a jacuzzi

Steamage

Van Damme fights guys all over the world in this one

You could say 'same old

same old

' but NO

This movie has a fight in a fire and in an elevator where the bad guy gets stained toes

Ouch

Cut back to the chase now

Van Damme and Henstridge make this movie work and it deserves to be purchased immediately
