We'll never quite know how the Academy overlooked this breathtaking masterpiece but it's one of the best adaptations I've seen of Hugo's classic

No easy ask to be riveted to a story one knows so well and has sludged through in both book and theatre form

but this production just has all its ducks in a row

The screenplay that hems in its multi-decade saga is put together with a pacy clip

the set designs of an Hosmanian France are credible

the dialogue is literate

and above all

the acting by the entire crew

particularly Geoffrey Rush

is immaculate

No flowery paeans needed

make place for it in your DVD collection

It's one of those
