This is another one of Spielberg's gems

See who actually made the contact

those shy aliens

Situations like this keep you guessing

But Spielberg was no fraud when it came to science fiction classic's

Would you have the guts to actually contact the alien

or perhaps get someone to do it for you

We would see then wouldn't we

Who has the answers huh

with all those advances those aliens had

they have nothing to fear

I dont think i would walk onto a spaceship with one

would you

You should look into this

it's actually a great package
