This is such a great

great

great film

It succeeds on so many levels and this new directors cut is the best presentation of this film yet

Many scenes are restored to the film that I think add nicely to the build up and some have been removed that add to the mystery at the end

such as not showing us the inside of the ship from Richard Dreyfuss's perspective

Also the use of Devils Tower

a black monolith combined with the eerie choral overture is a Spielberg homage to Kubrick's 2001

It is interesting to note that the government organization that is researching the aliens use the illuminati pyramid as their symbol indicating to the audience the secret society connections

they even have their own flag

Also I believe that Spielberg is clearly pointing out to us by the way the aliens arrive in clouds and thunder with flashing lights that they may very well be the God of the bible

Them choosing a mountain to appear for communication

descending upon it in cloud and thunder is right out of the old testament

Also the smaller ships have a definite face or animal like appearance and remind one of the visions of the bible prophets and from a distance can appear like stars in the sky when they mimic the big dipper which could also explain the ancient worlds fascination with the stars

But to remove all doubt Spielberg holds a church blessing on the team that will be going back with the aliens

as the minister gives the blessing he reads from a passage of the bible talking about angels lifting us up and in the background is a Christian cross side by side with the star of David

A deeper film than many believe
