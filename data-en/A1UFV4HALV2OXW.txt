In 1943

with the men at war

baseball owners created a professional women's league

Loosely based on a true story

A League of Their Own follows the inaugural season of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League

The movie stars Tom Hanks and Geena Davis (and features Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell) - and is so much fun to watch
