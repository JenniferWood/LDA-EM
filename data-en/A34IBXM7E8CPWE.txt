Wow





I watched the original film \"Gojira\" about 2 hourse before watching \"Mothra vs

Godzilla\"





talk about a drastic change in tone

Whereas \"Gojira\" is a dark tale about the horrors of the nuclear age





\"Mothra vs

Godzilla\" is simply fun

Sure there is a no-nukes message in \"MvG\" as well

it's just that the messenger is quite different this time around

When a huge egg washes up on the beach after a typhoon

some greedy businessman buys the egg from the local villagers

and he plans on making it a huge tourist attraction

Two little trophy top sisters arrive from Infant Island and beg the businessmen to give the egg back as it belongs to Mothra the defender of their island

The singing duo are worried that when the egg hatches the larvae could cause lots of damage

When they are refused the egg

the girls return to their bomb blasted island atop their giant moth friend

Of course

this is when Godzilla decides to attack





and the only hope of stopping him lies with the mini-girls and Mothra

This is a fun entry in the series

Mothra is a fun adversary

as are the larvae

This movie also features one of the best Godzilla \"awakening\" moments in the series as he burst out of the ground

The only issue I had with this entry is that Godzilla comes off as a clumsy oaf at times

The damage Godzilla causes seems to be almost accidental

at one point getting his tail caught in a large tower

pulling the structure down trying to free himself and then running into some buildings because of it

At another time

he's walking along and trips falling into a castle and clawing it apart as he tries to maintain his balance

Even in his showdown with Mothra the big guy trips and falls down a hill

The battles are fun

and tons of miniature tanks

buildings

bridges etc

get torn up in the process

so what else could you ask for

Not the best in the series

but far from the worst
