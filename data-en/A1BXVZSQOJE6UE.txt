I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out

I mean

what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph

Boy was I wrong

This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions

The acting is great

The actors are well known and correctly cast

Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job

Even the scenes and settings are wonderful

Two thumbs way up



For fans of this movie

look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses

Abraham

David

Jacob

and others

Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham
