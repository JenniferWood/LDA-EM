This movie serves its purpose well

You will completely fall in love with the story and want to read the book and see other movie adaptations

The story is so alive and fulfilling

it will not only capture your heart





it will in fact change the way you think

Is revenge sweet

Or

is forgiveness sweeter

What joy is there in the death of an enemy

Is there not more beauty in freeing the soul and making your enemy your friend

In all cases this is not possible

but our actions can speak to the heart

In Les Miserables

Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) gives of himself continually throughout the movie

He is the example of how a life can be changed through kindness

We find him on parole after 20 years of hard labor for stealing bread

Still unchanged by his punishment

he seeks to steal again from those who sought to be kind to him

While the owners of the house sleep

he steals their silverware

The next day he is caught and returned

What happens next will not only surprise you

but will set the mood for the entire movie

This is a story about two men who are given a second chance

Each takes a path and they then meet at the end again

One soul awakens to the chance to start again

the other

prison guard (Geoffrey Rush)

is filled with hate and can think of nothing but revenge

Not only is this about forgiveness but it is also about a father's love for his daughter and what he will give up

even though his daughter is adopted

He treats her as if she is his own child

His daughter falls in love with a handsome \"dangerous radical

\" ;> Who doesn't seem that dangerous

I really wish the story had been longer and they had put more into the character development of both Cosette (Claire Danes who really brightened up the screen)

Marius (who needed a lot more character development) and Fantine (Thurman who spent most of her time looking quite ill)

My favorite line: \"I didn't breath while you talked

I was afraid I'd miss a word

\" -CosetteThis movie may not be exactly as the story is written

but what movie have you ever seen that captured the complete story

If it makes you fall in love with the characters

then it has succeeded in making you hungry for more

Is that not the point

To get you to read the book

I sure found that to be true

A movie you will want to add to your top 100 collection

I would have loved if this movie had been much more complex

I could have watched this story for 4 or 5 hours

Basil Poledouris' score adds quite an appeal to this story and evokes the right emotions as a great soundtrack should

I also just became a fan of Liam Neeson

His character is almost mercy personified

Truly an inspiration and will change your life

One of the most beautiful movies you will ever see
