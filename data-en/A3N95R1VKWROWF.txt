A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it

but nevertheless

every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story

This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story

not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it

(For example

in this version

Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife

and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback

not found in the Bible

) The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were

The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality

and they show powerful character change by the end

It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")

The actor for Jacob does very well

too

(The actor for Joseph is fine

too

but the character couldn't have too much personality

because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like

) The movie introduced me to an interesting idea

which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham

The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life

whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots

So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time
