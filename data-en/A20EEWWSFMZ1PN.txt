An astronomer

Dan Aykroyd as Steve Mills

by way of a fluke

sends a message out of the galaxy

This causes a gravitational instability on that quadrant

An alien embassary

Kim Basinger as Celeste Martin

is sent to find and correct the problem

She is accompanied by Bag (Ann Prenttiss) who is ready to destroy anyone that gets in the way

There are lots of misunderstandings and sight gages

However the Alien learns of love and people (including Jimmy Durante)

This movie is just too jam-packed with fun to describe

You will have to see it again and again to pick up the parts that went by too fast
