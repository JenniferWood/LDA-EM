Hollywood runs 10 years behind

My friends and I were watching for UFOs in 1966

Somehow

Dreyfuss got into the three biggest movies of the 1970s

In Close Encounters

he is obsessed with an image in his mind

It turns out to be Devil's Tower in Wyoming

a vertical monolith created by erosion and the nation's first National Monument

Dreyfuss is drawn to an alien landing

\"The Third Kind\" indicates actual contact with UFOs

The film tries to create a sense of realism

So far

UFO stories have been hoaxes and science fiction

Where does Dreyfuss go with his aliens
