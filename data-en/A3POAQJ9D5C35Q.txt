Great acting team thrown together for this movie and of course great acting

The main character was showing &#34;faith&#34; while the country on the whole was trying to fight for liberty as the UnitedStates was

ONLY the French were not a Christian based or cultured people

so faith of it's people was little

God wasn't backing their country if they're not going to ask Him to help

So this show the torturous times that people went through going through this country's wars

Really a good movie
