This interesting road movie/ crime drama is a worthwile directional debut for Kiefer Sutherland

a gripping low budget effort that easily stands above many disposable mainstream action blockbusters

The story brings nothing new

consisting in another heist situation where we are presented to a bunch of criminals and their operations

What makes the movie work is the character development

since these criminals are three-dimensional individuals and the viewer actually gets to know them as flawed people and not merely one-sided badass charicatures

Sutherland gets some ideas from a couple of Tarantino and Roger Rodriguez` films

going for the young-villains-on-the-run perspective with some witty and offbeat scenes
