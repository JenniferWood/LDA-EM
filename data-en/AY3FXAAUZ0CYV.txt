Shirley MacLaine and Nicolas Cage are magic in this movie

Hugh Wilson deserves kudos for his excellent direction in this superior film

Nicolas Cage plays the part of an intelligent

aspiring Secret Service agent who thinks that he's completing his tour of duty with former First Lady Tess Carlisle

when

to his dismay

she's requested that he stay on permanent assignment

He tries on various occasions to sabotage his assignment through outrageous acts directed towards Tess

but the old political warhorse turns around every situation to her benefit

calling the President and complaining

to the point that the President is calling up Cage and chewing him out to get along with the &quot;cagey&quot; first lady

Underneath the friction are suble revelations that change the entire outlook of the movie

For instance

one begins to realize how much Cage cares for the former first lady's husband in a scene where she watches old videos of her husband's funeral when

spotted in the congregation

Cage is lowering his head to shed tears at the passing of the President

Further revelations unfold when Tess visits with her son that results in a very unsatisfactory

shallow encounter leaves her feeling a need to make a connection with someone who actually cares for her

and Agent Cheznic fulfills this need without even realizing it

Subtle

classy humor is the rule of the day

and Cage and MacLaine pull it off in style

The pace picks up towards the last half of the movie when the first lady is kidnapped

and Cage

through feelings of affection and guilt

turns up the heat on the situation and suspects to begin a frantic search

Watch carefully and watch again at the many subtle scenes and extremely excellent performances by this cast of gifted actors
