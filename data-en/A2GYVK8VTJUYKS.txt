I admit that I am a baseball junkie and did not know as much about this part of the great american pastime as I should have and before I saw the movie I did not know the historical perspective of the subject matter

But that changed

This is just an out and out great movie with a wonderful cast

Tom Hanks and Geena Davis turn in wonderful performances

I am not a big fan of either Madonna or Rosie O'Donnell

but because of their efforts in this movie I do take a double look whenever I ssee their names because they were brilliant here

And the comdey is steller

It is full of memorable lines that have become part of baseball's lexicon (well at least for baseball fans) with \"There's no Crying In Baseball\" something that is used by everyone everywhere nowadays

probably more so than any other catch phrase from any movie that many people know

Laughs and even bittersweet tears permeate the movie and Penny Marshall turns in her usual top notch ability to make a movie that is memorable and enjoyable

And it has a good bit of baseball history thrown in to boot
