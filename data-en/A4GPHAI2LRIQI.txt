Just to further comment on the music licensing issues surely holding back the release of this brilliant show on DVD



I can think of a show that had practically no audience when it aired

had wall-to-wall classic rock tunes

and had a great deal of success on the DVD market

I'm talking about FREAKS AND GEEKS

Another brilliant show whose DVD success MORE than made up for it's costs to license the incredible soundtrack

Knowing that WKRP was considerably more successful during it's original tenure on CBS should be proof positive that this would be well worth the investment in releasing it with all original music intact
