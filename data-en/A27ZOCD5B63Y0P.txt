I first saw NORTH AVENUE IRREGULARS about 25 years ago

Recently I decided it was time to give it another go

To my surprise

I had just as much fun watching it in my 30s as I did when I was a kid

To my even bigger surprise

my wife had more fun watching it than she would have on a rollercoaster ride

NORTH AVENUE IRREGULARS was one of Disney's final attempts at a fun family film (that the whole family could watch together)

during the waning years of the era in which clean films were still marketable

The title is derived from the \"Baker Street Irregulars\" -- Sherlock Holmes's reliable band of young London ruffians who could spy on the suspicious and unsuspecting and deliver the inside scoop

But instead of Sherlock

we have a nave yet determined young preacher who is bent on cleaning up his city

And instead of young ruffians

he depends on the church women -- young beauties

grandmothers

and soccer moms

With the help of two federal agents this unlikely group of enforcers give the local mob a run for their money

What you'll find in NORTH AVENUE is a lot of zany situational comedy as well as high speed car chases and classic cinema CB-radio chatter -- which has been replaced by the cell phone and other technologies in today's movies

It also boasts a climactic all-out derby that would make SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT jealous

What you won't find in NORTH AVENUE is profanity

blasphemy

gratuitous violence

or sexual immorality

If this movie were remade today

they would probably have the preacher (the hero of the movie) in an adulterous affair with one or more of the women he recruits

Fortunately

NORTH AVENUE was made before garbage like that became popular in Hollywood

This movie is filled with good

clean fun and has plenty of \"rewatchability\"
