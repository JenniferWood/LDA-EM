There are many things I like about this movie and all those reasons have been said before here

It's so hard to find scripts today with even average mature adult dialogue out of the US industry

Whenever I watch it it's always a treat to hear some great moments of dialogue that say so much with so few words and get you thinking if I was in there position revisiting my past





wouldn't that be interesting

Some people don't care for Nicolas' performance

but again

he has some excellent dialogue with Peggy

What a great script sharing thoughts of mature people but in a more light hearted way instead of reality TV conflicts

Kathleen does give a great performance but so do others

Barbara Harris

Joan Allen (where I first took notice of this excellent actress)

Maureen O'Sullivan and then look for young Jim Carrey (not overplayed

overly comical

perfectly cast) and others

I would love to go back for a short visit my parents and grandparents and face what would I say to them knowing what I know now

This movie did that well without making it overly comical when say Marty goes back and visits his parents in Back to the Future

That's not to criticize Back to the Future

different kind of movie and I loved those scenes

Peggy Sue Got Married is a warmer fuzzier approach to what could be sci-fi plot

time travel no less

It really let's us know that we do change as we age

and sometimes that change results in a life that is incoherent with the past

especially the relationships we started with innocence and love

and precious honesty

How and why do we let go of that

When is right

When is a detriment

That's what Peggy comes to face

and perhaps she will find herself healed and renewed
