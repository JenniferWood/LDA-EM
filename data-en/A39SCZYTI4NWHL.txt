Victor Hugo nailed one of society's imperfections in trying to make people adhere to the law without any mercy or compassion

which robs justice more than the original infraction

The theft of a loaf of bread to lessen the desparate cravings of his starving family

probably shouldn't go unpunished by some sort of community service or restitution to the seller

However

being incarcerated for 5 years and then being branded for life as a convict goes against any sense of real justice

I'm often reminded of \"Les Miserables\" when I hear of grade school leaders issuing their \"no tolerance rules\" and then a young child is caught in violation

which results in a severe reprimand that scars the child for life

The callousness of handing down such sentencing with no apparent use of the discernment skills school leaders are usually esteemed for is the same miscarriage of justice witnessed by those familiar with this classic tale
