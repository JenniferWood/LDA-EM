I remember buying the CLV Criterion laserdisc back in the early '90s of the original release and was in awe at the detail

I later bought the ultimate director's cut LD (the same ultimate director's cut on this release) and was really disappointed at the low level of detail even though the sound was really good

I resisted buying the DVD because that I didn't want to buy it again while not being certain that the picture would be really great

LDs' sound have always put the sound on DVDs to shame

So I waited for a Superbit version of the film but it never came

When I saw that it would be released on Blu-ray I simply jumped at the change and pre-ordered it right away

When the discs arrived I was extremely pleased that the picture at last was of a quality that the film deserves

There are film grain visible but it doesn't matter since almost all 35mm releases have visible film grain on Blu-ray disc (I expect the same is true of HD DVD releases too)

The picture was quite simply magnificent

the level of detail was very rich and the colors were very vibrant

The colors of the picture of BD releases is what I really am impressed with and this movie shines

The sound was a little different matter

I use a PS3 to watch BD movies with an optical cable to my Yamaha amp with only Dolby Digital decoder (no DTS decoder) so when I watch the movies I use the DD track if available

The DD core of the Dolby TrueHD track was only 448 kbps instead of 640 kbps (all other Dolby TrueHD titles that I have have a 640 kbps DD core) and it was a little underwhelming

being the same sound quality as the DD track on DVDs

But when I set up my PS3 to decode the Dolby TrueHD track as a 2 channel LPCM track the soundtrack really excelled

The film originally was mixed in Dolby surround so to use the surround processor on my amp to play the surround sound in mono on my back speakers didn't bother me

The detail in the sound

especially at the end of the film

was so rich

I know this is not a fair assessment of the Dolby TrueHD sound

but Sony should have but a 640 kbps core on the TrueHD track

like with the Spider-man trilogy

I am really looking forward to getting an amp with HDMI input to process the true HD sound from both Dolby TrueHD and uncompressed PCM BDs (and DTS-HD MA when the PS3 can decode it)

The extras were basically the same as on my old LD Sony release with a great in-depth documentary on the making of the movie

the special edition (released in 1980) and director's cut

It also included a new 2007 interview with Spielberg reflecting on the movie after 30 years (the documentary was made in 1997

20 years after the original release)

In the case there was a booklet with some text on the making of the film with lots of pictures and a fold out with the film poster on one side and on the other side there is a outline of the differences of the three versions of the film with three timelines (one for each version) and notes pointing to various points with comments

What I really miss is a commentary track with Spielberg on each of the versions

I don't think that there is a single movie of his that has a commentary track on either BD or DVD

It would be perfect with a commentary track

As it stands this release is really good

Some have complained on the lack of a BD plastic cover and I can understand it but with this content it is well worth the price (some have complained on that too) and I would recommend this release to all sci-fans

Addition on 17

January 2008:I have since I reviewed it bought an amp with HDMI to hear the uncompressed PCM sound from my PS3

I must say how that the sound is truly amazing

It is so full and detailed

The bass

especially in the scene with Dreyfuss in the truck in the beginning

is truly spectacular

The sequence at the end behind Devil's Tower is a feast for the ear

I have only been able to get the HD sound from the Dolby TrueHD track but I would expect the DTS HD-MA track is equally impressive since both is a lossless format
