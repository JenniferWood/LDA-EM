The North Avenue Irregulars was Disney's best attempt to revive its family film franchise

They started by choosing a true story and then giving it that Disney touch

Next they collected a group of up and coming actors from Broadway and television

The North Avenue Presbyterian Church has a new minister

He wants to get the congregation more involved in the affairs of the church

so his first action is to give charge of the sinking fund to Rose Delaney (Patsy Kelly)

The thing that he does not know is that her husband is a compulsive gambler

When she tells him that Rafterty has bet the whole $1

206 on a horse race

he goes to stop the wager but is too late

When he asks for the money back

he is given the door

That night he goes on local television and instead of giving his planned sermon

he goes on a tirade about illegal gambling and the police looking the other way

This gets the eye of the FBI (Michael Constantine and Steve Franken) and Reverend Hill (Edward Herrmann) is asked about set up a sting operation

The reverend goes to all the men in the congregation but they are unwilling to go up against the mob

But his crew of church ladies are ready to run the sting

The crew includes

the professional mom

Vickie (Barbara Harris)

the bride to be

Annie (Karen Valentine)

the rich perpetual single

Claire (Cloris Leachman)

the retiree

Rose (Patsy Kelly) and the wife of a small business owner

Cleo (Virginia Capers)

Their first attempts at the sting are miserable flops

So rather than try to dry up the sources they decide to go after the bank

The girl try to follow the courier back to home base and after many hilarious attempts they finally find the bank and take on the syndicate in a wild demolition derby

This is not a great film

It often goes over the top

But it is just an all out fun film with no gratuitous sex or obscene language

This has some of the best all out great visual gags including Cloris Leachman becoming a maniac after breaking all her fingernails

Although this film took place back east

it was shot in the San Fernando Valley (Southern California)

Watch during the pursuit scenes one of the street signs says Lankershiem Boulevard

a major street in the valley

This is a highly talented cast including Tony Award winners (Barbara Harris

Virginia Capers and Patsy Kelly)

Emmy Award winners (Cloris Leachman

Michael Constantine

Karen Valentine

Susan Clark and Edward Herrmann) and an Oscar winner (Leachman)

And that was before they made this film

This is one of the best of the later Disney family films and will always be a great time
