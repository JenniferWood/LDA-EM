If you enjoy watching birds

especially hummers

you will enjoy watching this incredible video

About an hour ago Mrs

Spudman and I watched First Flight and we were both enthralled

Through most of the video I was stunned by the sight of things I had never seen before like the tiny hummingbird eggs

the laying of the two eggs

the hatching

and of course the first flight of the two hummingbird fledglings

This video was three years in the making because of weather

missed shots and the hummingbirds' unwillingness to take direction

The film itself is a masterpiece and the short documentary explaining the making of the film was also quite interesting

Also included on the DVD is a slide show of hummingbirds

The only shots of the colorful males are shown in the slide show

Honey

the mother hummingbird

built the nest and nurtured her young solo

We were disappointed the video wasn't a little longer

but like the hummingbird

beautiful things can appear in small packages
