A few days ago I purchased the first season of \"Murphy Brown\" on DVD

Since then I've been pondering what other TV shows I enjoyed enough to warrant buying episodes on DVD

\"WKRP\" tops the very short list (#2 is the \"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour

\" and the list ends there)

Did someone here refer to Jan Smithers (Bailey Quarters) as \"truly lovely\"

Amen

brother

I logged onto Amazon tonight specifically to see if a \"WKRP\" DVD is available and I had just missed it

No such luck

Interestingly

I see that \"Gilligan's Island\" IS out on disc





yeah

that makes sense

Thank you to the folks here who warned of the edits made on the VHS product

I'd have purchased them and been very disappointed

I anxiously await a quality DVD reissue

My credit card is ready

And to whatever entities might be dragging their heels on the project

these words seem fitting:OH MY GOD

THEY'RE TURKEYS
