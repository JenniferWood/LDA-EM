It's obviously not easy to compress for the screen something as complex

vast

and subtle as Hugo's novel

particularly when the focus of the book is internal and a movie is necessarily something that is focused on the external

Coupled to these difficulties comes the inevitable Hollywood fixation on test market inputs

happy endings

and schlock-horror-thrills violence

The result is a movie like this

which starts moderately well and then ambles off the rails around the mid-way point

Liam Neeson is an accomplished actor

but you wouldn't necessarily know that from this movie

His Jean Valjean lacks nuance

perhaps because he's forced into portraying situations that are at times in conflict with the essence of who Valjean is supposed (pace Hugo) to be

His redemption scene is brief and superficial

and his supposed inner torment during the crucial trial scene (in which he ultimately elects to confess his true identity in order to save the idiot in the dock) resembles nothing so much as a man trying to determine which flavor of ice cream to select from the freezer

The only bright spot is Uma Thurman's performance

which is both unexpectedly accomplished and deeply moving

If only Neeson could have produced a performance to match this would have made the movie worth watching

As for the fabricated love-story conclusion which owes nothing to Hugo and everything to Hollywood

the less said about that the better except for the masterful camera work

in which Valjean's spiritual euphoria is brilliantly conveyed by a long tracking shot that gradually opens up from the gray of the quayside to include finally the features of Paris and the open sky

If you enjoyed Hugo's book you'd be much better off seeing the French version with Gerard Depardieu

or better still find the wonderful 1990 interpretation starring Jean-Paul Belmondo

which avoids all the normal pitfalls of bringing a huge book to the screen while capturing the essence and subtlety of Hugo's masterpiece
