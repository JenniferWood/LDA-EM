I just got done watching this for the third time

The first two times

I had seen it on TV

and kept getting interrupted

Either by people talking so that I couldn't hear

or having to leave the TV and missing scenes

So

when I finally got to sit down and watch this straight through

I was blown away like it was the first time

This is one of those movies that you can watch no matter what mood you are in

and end up feeling good

This DVD contains the best version of it

too

There was an original and a special edition

The special edition cut out the scene of Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) tearing up his yard and throwing dirt and stuff in his window for a scene of him breaking down in the bathroom

Personally

I find the first scene to be more interesting and entertaining

but the second is more vital to the story because it shows that he thinks he's going nuts and so does his family

But

not to worry because BOTH scenes are spliced into the movie

Also

the SE had and extended ending of Neary in the spaceship which isn't spliced into this one

This movie

no matter how many times you see it

holds you spellbound

Everyone was brilliant in this

Speilberg's directing

Dreyfuss's acting (his performance in Jaws was damn good

but nothing compared to this)

Terri Garr's acting

John Williams' musical score (somebody give him a lifetime achievement award

or better yet

three)

and Paul Schrader-that's right

Paul Schrader's-brilliant screenplay

Yep

the man who brought you such masterpieces as Taxi Driver as wrote this

Speilberg rewrote it so much

though (probably because it was too dark

as Schrader's work tends to be)

and Schrader said he didn't want anything to do with the new script

Regardless of who wrote it

it's perfect and entertaining as all hell

You would think that a movie of this caliber

with such a climactic and intense ending

would lose it's power to leave you staring at the screen in awe

but it doesn't

During the whole last half of the movie (the close encounter and the events leading up to it)

I was not only riveted

I was anxious and nervous

Just like the first time I saw it

I was doing all those nasty habits I do when I get anxious or nervous

even though I KNEW what was going to happen

That's how friggin POWERFUL this movie is

Everyone knows the basic plot to this movie

but it doesn't matter

It spins it web over you

and you can't help but get caught in it every time

Now

about the DVD

Whoever put this DVD together is almost as brilliant as the people who made the movie

It's 11 deleted scenes show you everything that was taken out of the movie (the extending ending

etc

)

and then some

The 100 minute(

) documentary is fascinating

if it had been any shorter(like those twenty minute ones

or even worse

one of those 7 minute \"featurettes\") I would have been mad as hell

Again

hats off to whoever made it

It also includes a featurette called Watch the Skies

which I admit that I haven't got around to yet

because I've been busy with the other features

and of course watching the movie

But even if the featurette wouldn't have been included at all

the documentary more than makes up for it

The DVD also includes trailers

which no one really cares about usually

but I always get a kick out of them

The best thing about this

though

is the restored picture and sound

The Dolby 5

1 sounds even better than the original sound





And the picture is a million times better than VHS

Definitely a noticeable difference



Oh yeah

the reason for my title is of course because this movie makes you use your brain

but it also leaves you feeling good after you watched with wonder as the close encounter unfolded

Let me just say that this is one of the best sci-fi movies

Except most of it isn't a sci-fi movie

so you don't need to be a sci-fi nut to enjoy it



This DVD NEEDS to be in your collection
