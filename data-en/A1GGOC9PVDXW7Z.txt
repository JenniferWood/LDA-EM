A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is the often amusing

sometimes touching biopic of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League

which was organized in 1942

The story centers on two highly competitive sisters

teammates on the Rockford (IL) Peaches

and their disgruntled

uninterested manager

a former major league superstar who took to the bottle after a career-ending knee injury

After the country is combed for prospects

the fledgling AAGPBL is formed

During games

players must wear outfits with short skirts and are expected to flaunt their charms

but off the field they have to comport themselves like proper ladies

Some calculated publicity along with skillful ballplaying eventually turn the once struggling league into a moneymaking enterprise

but with the war winding down and all the men due home

the girls are expected to return to their former lives

As true competitors however

they won't simply pack it in and go away

Meanwhile

a very exciting season is coming to a close

with the Peaches battling the Racine (WI) Belles for the championship

Several actors enrich this film with talents they bring to otherwise minor roles

David Strathairn's earnest portrayal of a P

R

man who struggles to preserve the girls' league once WWII ends

Pauline Brailsford as prissy Miss Cuthbert

the laugh-out-loud one-liners of league scout Jon Lovitz

Ann Cusack's scatterbrained Shirley Baker

Tracy Reiner's touching performance as 'Betty Spaghetti' and Megan Cavanagh's ultra-shy power-hitting Marla Hooch are particular stand-outs
