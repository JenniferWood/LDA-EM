This turned out to be a childhood favorite of mine

Back in the late 90's

I was obssessed with Spielberg's sci-fi classic

Close Encounters of the Third Kind

I admired the \"brilliant\" UFO designs

and the stunning performance of Richard Dreyfuss

Now

I can see that this film hasn't experienced any wear and tear

except maybe the commercial products that were used in the film

The special effects are still mesmerizing

the characters are still engaging

and even though I'm a fan of John Williams

the otherworldly music is still spectacular

Francois Truffaut steals the show as Claude Lacombe

but Dreyfuss is also worthy of mention

He plays Roy Neary

a man who has just had a \"close encounter\" with a trio of unidentified flying objects

and is becoming increasingly obssessive with a mountain-like shape that he seems to see in everyday objects

He should have won the oscar for this film

instead of \"The Goodbye Girl

\"Thank goodness that Star Wars

which was released in theaters in the same year

didn't overshadow this arguably important sci-fi film

It's one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made

and it one of my favorites alongside 2001: A Space Odyssey & John Carpenter's The Thing

Grade: A
