I bought a Blu ray player a few months ago

At 39 years old I was really hoping to see some of my favorite movies in this new HD format

Some movies seem to really benefit from this format (Kubrick's re-releases

Fifth Element

etc

)

And some movies don't seem to take full advantage of the HD format

So it is with great pleasure that I say that this edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind is quite simply \"amazing

\" Yes

the film is 30 years old

And some grain is to be expected

But wow

what a transfer

The colors pop off the screen

The contrast is nice and sharp

but not in a bad way

The dark scenes are virtually flawless

The color tones
