and I have no idea how many times I've watched the awesome and stunning masterpiece \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\" indeed is

The effects (still today

and not just for its' time) somehow work to make the movie timeless

and the same with the story

How many people doesn't still look to the sky for answers of the great unknown that's above us for sure

the universe is there serving us with its' giantness and all that yet undiscovered out there making our imagination go wild -and that's what makes this movie as facinating as it still is today

The wondeful Richard Dreyfuss in the lead

of course it is well acted -from most of the actors at least

The locations

somewhere in Montana (

) -perfect

Beautiful pictures of the nightsky

fantastic spaceship(s)

the movie is sometimes witty

sometimes sad and gripping -the story being as complex yet as simple as it is

It's the story of a family falling apart

and a story of serial of un-explainable events witnessed by a father (Dreyfuss) that drives him to do things that makes it look as if he is going insane

he becomes obsessed

And much more to that of course

I have no idea which version I have seen

could they not just release the extended version once and for all

That is the only stupid thing about this movie

or perhaps its' makers that is

Great picture

great sound (dts)

legendary movie
