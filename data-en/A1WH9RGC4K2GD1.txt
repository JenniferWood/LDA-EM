I loved this movie because it is about the extent to which a man goes

to make sure that his offspring is successful in life after he is gone

Or at least that is how I took it

that it is about a man who wants more than anything

more than happiness in his own life

for his son to stand on his shoulders and go even farther in the world and he spends his life setting things up for his son to learn what he needs to learn so that he will be on top

a big success and so he can make sure his own offspring remain on top in society and have the greatest success Too

It is about striving to make sure that your LINE

survives and thrives

It ruins the life of the man who is the father

but the only thing he cares about is for his son to stand on his shoulders and go farther because he gave him all that was necessary in life to achieve

I believe that when you have children

that the most important thing in your life becomes making sure that they are successful in life and can take care of the next generation so that for generations

your offspring and their offspring and their offspring

and on and on

are successful people in life and all rise to the top

that they do not fail

To do this

to accomplish this in your lifetime parents often have to push and force children to educate themselves extremely well in order to have that success

before they even fully appreciate that it is necessary to do all the preparation IN Order to have the kind of life that will enable them to help their own offspring go on to school (for example) and prepare themselves to go on to greatness for the next generation and so on

so that a family line can remain on top in life over many many generations

This is about a man who understood what it takes to be on top and after he had a son

the only thing he cares about in life and felt a great obligation to

was his son

and to make sure that no matter what happened in life

after he was gone

that his son would be able to rise to the top and be successful and be able to take his own children and propell them to the top too

It is a very sad movie about what it takes and how some men care so much about accomplishing this most important goal in life that they sacrifice much in their own lives to get the end result

It takes place long ago and is a story of the ages

I LOVE This movie

Really

it is about a man who very deeply loves his son

and whose ONLY care in life is to make sure that his son stands on his shoulders and goes farther in life than he

While he is working toward this goal

the son is full of hate for his father

never understanding that it is from the deepest love for him that any father could ever have

that he has done everything he did in life

The father loves the son so much that ONLY the sons success in life matters to him

even if it ruins his own life

that his life is only for giving everything to his son

So it is about devotion to the offspring you create and going all the way to make sure that your child or children succeed in life

You do not understand the hated father until the end

A very powerful film and a story that has been going on for thousands of years in men who achieve greatness and who do Everything possible to make sure their line remains great

I think like this

understand this view and recognize that this is the path exceptionally strong and hugely successful men have taken in life over thousands of years
