Great picture

Very sharp image and color was right on

Better audio than DVD and I'm not sure the special edition has even been released on DVD or Blu-Ray

If you still have a Laserdisc player tucked away in the closet then this is the release you want to watch

Audio was wonderful and picture was very clear

Laserdisc were a little cumbersome but when you hear and see what they can do with this release then Maybe it's worth a look back

Unless you have Blu ray

Then I may change my mind but this is an A in my book
