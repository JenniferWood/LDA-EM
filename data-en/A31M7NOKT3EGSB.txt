Mothra vs

Godzilla is one of the best Godzilla films ever

The bright colors

the excellent special effects

the monster action

and a basic

yet interesting plot all come together and make this movie what it is

This movie is just pure fun for any fan of giant monsters and/or old-school sci-fi flicks

This movie is also a lot less campy than the future films in the series

As a sci-fi film

it's four stars

but among Godzilla films

it's easily five

If you're already a Godzilla fan

don't hesitate to pick this up as soon as you can
