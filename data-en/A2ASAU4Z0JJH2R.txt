Directed by Ringo Lam (Replicant)

this flick is both fun and intense

The action sequences (martial-arts aside) are impressive and shocking

Van Damme takes on double-duty as twin brothers

but his role is moreover played by a confused outsider who doesn't understand his roots

The acting (all around) is believable

and the scenario is darker than Van Dammes' previous roles

Enjoy this trip on the wild-side

as Jean Claude actually plays a convincing role caught in the middle of corruption

So you don't like Jean-Claude

Go away

Though no acting genius

Van Damme hasn't tried to be something he is not (Stallone

Schwarzenegger) and he has stuck to fun films that can be enjoyed by all

Director Ringo Lam has thrown a twist into the average Van Damme film

It's actually interesting beyond incredible martial arts

Yes

people

there is a story here

This is a big-budget

blow-your-mind special-effects extravaganza that leaves you saying

how





did they do that

Strap in and hang on

This is Van Dammage like you've never seen before
