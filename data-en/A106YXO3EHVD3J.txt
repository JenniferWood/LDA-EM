Godzilla VS The Thing ( U

S

title) is one of my favorites from the Showa era

It marks Godzilla's 4th screen appearance and also Godzilla's definitive look

which would remain close to this design for the remainder of this time period

I saw this among other early ToHo films at my local theater so I remember them well on the big screen

I have a couple of editions of this film

but this review is for the Classic Media release that includes both U

S

and Japanese versions of the film

This is by far the best release to date with the film looking very good

grain is present and some light wear

but it looks the way I remember it

This one has Godzilla battling Mothra and its two offspring

There is lots of talk in this one

but as always plenty of destruction too

It's one of the more unique sequels in the series

The bonus material is also quite good

but I would wish there were at least some sort of making of or a documentary in English

Other than that

this is a solid release for fans of the G Man
