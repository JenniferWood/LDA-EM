In many ways

this is my favorite Spielberg film

It has an almost brash innocence missing from many of his later

more self-conscious and overproduced works

There are so many classic scenes here

The fighter squadron in the desert

The alien encounter on the lonely road

The moment Dreyfuss recognizes the mountain's shape

The interview with Truffaut in the Army base camp

The kid being abducted and carried off into the clouds with the mother desperately running after





wow

Great stuff

In fact

I think I'm gonna put it on the ol' DVD player right now
