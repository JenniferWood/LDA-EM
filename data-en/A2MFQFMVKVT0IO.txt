Classic Media releases of the Godzilla series have been outstanding

However

they fell short including a cropped version of \"Godzilla VS The Thing\" at 1

78:1

Don't understand why they did this when it was released 2

35:1 aspect ratio in the US

I looked forward to watching it for the extra footage not in the Japan version

For those interested

there is a DVD release of Godzilla VS Mothra released by Simitar in the proper 2:35:1 aspect ratio (though not anamorphic) some time ago

I was able to pick up a copy ordering from Amazon and is still available to my knowlege

The five stars is for the outstanding Japan version shown it's proper aspect ratio on this DVD
