&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;

At least the characters names are changed in this movie

I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them

This is not my most favorite version of all

but it is maybe my fourth favorite

I like the original story better

that is why I gave it 4 stars

It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge

even with the name changes

It is the same general idea

I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story
