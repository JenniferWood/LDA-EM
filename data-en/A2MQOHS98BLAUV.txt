This is a fabulous release of one of my all-time favorites and there's not much I can add to what's already been said

The only thing that puzzles me is why - with all the \"Collector's\" editions and \"Ultimate\" editions that have been released over the last few years - they have not included Spielberg's very first UFO film - \"Firelight\"

Made in 1964 when he was 16 years old

\"Firelight\" has often been cited by Spielberg as his low-budget ($500) version of Close Encounters

Most folks have never seen it and I don't believe it's ever been available on video but it would certainly interest die-hard fans of \"Close Encounters\"

as a glimpse into the early inspiration of a great film and the evolution of a great filmmaker
