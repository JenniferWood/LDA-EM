This evening's featured late-nite movie was \"Truth or Consequences

NM

\" Strange name for a town

I remember when it got that name

It used to be named Hot Springs

or something like that

They changed it to T

or C

after the name of a TV-radio quiz show of the late 40s-early 50s

In any case

the final scenes of the movie were supposedly at Truth or Consequences

NM

Actually

the geology looked more like that of the Zion Park area of Utah about 400 miles to the west-horthwest

Sorry 'bout that

I'm a geologist and I always notice such details

Sometimes it ruins the movie

Not in this case

It made the movie more interesting

I don't know whether to call this a road movie or a chase movie

I guess it was a chase movie on the roads

Geographically

however

it was all mixed up and I found that distracting

The plot had some cheap hoods stealing dope and then transporting it around to seek their fortune in it's sale

Alas

they stole it from the mob and attempted to sell it back to the mob

Not a smart move

The cops were in hot pursuit and

the mob was in hot pursuit after the four guys and the dope

Did I mention that there were two women with the guys

Well

what would a story be without a few women along

In any case

this little melange of bad guys (the girls were OK) were on a rampage across the southwester US stealing cars and leaving a trail of dead bodies

How many dead

Well

I lost track by about 2/3 through the movie and most of the deaths were at the end

All of the original group (except one undercover cop in their midst) met their maker

even the women

Was it a violent movie

Well

yes

Was the violence a main selling point of the movie

Probably

I don't know what any other selling point would be

Was the plot of any value and scope other than the violence

Not really

Was the acting any good

Well

it was neither particularly good nor bad

Was the movie entertaining

Yaawwwnnnn

Would you recommend the movie to a friend

Hmmmm

Interesting question
