The movie itself is of course 5 stars

But this one disk Blu-ray has NO special features other than \"Watch The Skies\" which only catalogs the differences between the 3 movie editions (Original

Special Edition

Director's Cut) - Spend the extra $5 for the 2-disk set

or you may wind up kicking yourself
