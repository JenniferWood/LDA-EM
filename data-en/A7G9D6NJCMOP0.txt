AWESOME

Must have on Blu-ray; actually

any of Spielberg's films will do fine

I can't hardly wait for his other films to come out in Hi-def

This film rates high on my list

along with the newly released \"Bladerunner\" on Blu-ray

Now I'm going to look at the San Fernando Valley at night in a different respect as Spielberg did for his concept look for the Mother spaceship
