Back in the 60s the first ever Godzilla VS Mothra came out

and this is it

There is not TO much to say about this film

it is a good film

how ever it does have some problems

for Example

Mothra is just a flying moth

it does not really have that much attack options

just flying

and releasing bowel movements on the enemy

There fore the battles are not ultra spectacular

but are still good
