To begin with: I love Emmit Otter's Jug Band Christmas

This is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all

Resembling O

Henry's The Gift of the Magi (But sort of reversed) the tale is endearing

I recorded Emmit off the air years ago and it has been part of my Christmas collection viewed every year several times

When I found the DVD I ordered one

It came in March 2002 and I opened it and watched the whole thing right away

To my dismay it had CHANGED

Scenes

dialog

and even songs had been changed

rearranged

and even deleted

For Example:The lyrics to &quot;There Ain't No Hole In The Washtub&quot; were changed

The confrontation between Alice Otter &amp; Gretchen Fox was shortened

Kermit's closing remarks were deleted

My family and I have seen this classic so many times that we can recite it by memory

What a disappointment that someone decided to change what was already a fine product

If you don't have it all memorized

or don't mind when stories are made more Politically Correct then please buy it

it's still a fine story and teaches a good lesson
