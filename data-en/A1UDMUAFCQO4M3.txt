This is a great flick about the reasons people are cruel and manipulate others: simply

because they can

Aaron Eckhart does a great job playing the main character

Chad

a man that will make you hate all men

But

what I took away from this was not only how cruel men can be

but people in general

This movie is about more than misogyny

And

it's great to watch just for Eckhart's performance alone

BOTTOM LINE: It's not cheezy

there's no fancy music to sway you to one side or the other

It's

instead

a dark look at men and politics in the corporate world

full of simple yet telling dialogue

definetly worth a watch

GRADE: B+
