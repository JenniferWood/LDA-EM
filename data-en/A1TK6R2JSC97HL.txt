It's unclear who \"Character\" - which otherwise tells the story of a luckless man locked in battle with his biological father - refers to

Set in Europe after the first world war

\"Character\" presents us with a fearsome figure: Arend Dreverhaven (Jan Declair)

the local \"Bailiff\"

In uncertain times

when nobody can be sure how long they'll have a job or a roof over their head

Dreverhaven fearlessly and contemptuously wields his power to divest whole communities of both

Physically large

he can stare down whole battalions of armed communists single-handedly

or jump into the sea to re-possess a ship

(In a chilling dream sequence

he evicts an entire building's tenants wearing no more than his bailiff's medal

) In a lesser film

Dreveraven would be easy to dismiss as a coward

cloaking his weakness behind the power of the office

but \"Character\" goes a braver route - Dreverhaven has his fears

but he's still the power behind the position

He's driven to possess the one thing he can't get - the love of Joba

his former housekeeper and the one woman who slept with him

Though the script is murky on whether Joba consented to their coupling

she makes it crystal clear that she wants nothing to do with him - whether for herself or their \"son\"

Proving she's as strong willed as Dreverhaven

she coldly rebuffs his efforts to control or support them

especially the pathological way he repeatedly proposes to her over the years - even as the two enter the inescapable redoubt of old age

Not taking \"no\" for answer very well

Dreverhaven wages a war against Jacob Willem

the illegitimate son who will rise into respectable manhood by dint of serious labor

Though already having the world against him

(poverty and bastardy are bad enough alone) Jacob finds himself under the gun

Dreverhaven buys up Jacob's debts

hounding the boy into poverty

Jacob rises to the occasion - he defeats Dreverhaven in bankruptcy court

twice

He even nabs a job as a clerk in the town's house of finance

a move with potential for a respectable and lucrative future

light years away from the wretched existence into which he was born

Unfortunately

Willem too is driven by fear and hatred of the old man - having just redeemed his last debts to Dreverhaven

he boldly incurs a new one

relishing the chance to beat the old man again

He also confuses success with happiness

discarding a pretty fellow worker whose affections offer him nothing in his private war

Dreverhaven's motives are unclear - though the script ingeniously works this dilemma into the story

Dreverhaven boldly tells Joba that he'll strangle his son for nine-tenths to make a man out of him

since that's the only way he can legitimize Jacob Willem as his son

He obviously wants Joba

but only if he can make their boy into a mirror image of himself

When Joba rebuffs him one last time

however

he decides it's time to go after that last 10th

Unfortunately

for both our heroes and the story

Joba soon dies

a move that robs the story of its emotional force and complexity

and boils it down to a clash of wills in which both characters go after that last bit of their lives left un-strangled

It's no surprise who survives the other - the script is based on Jacob's \"confession\" to the police after the old man is found dead in the solitary gloom of his office

after a fight Jacob admits the two had

While serious film lovers see it as an alternative to Hollywood sludge (another reviewer wrote that

I didn't make it up)

the film's theme of \"father v

son\" is pure Hollywood

The script's sub-text of an evil-elder figure who elevates a younger hero by making his life hell was already old when Willem Defoe used it in \"Spiderman\"

(James Earle Jones used it against Mark Hamill in the \"Star Wars\" movies and against Schwarzennegar in the first \"Conan\" flick - and that was over 20 years ago

) Also

the film's obviously high production values means it will never be a favorite with the Dogme set

That said

\"Character\" gives us the timeless Oedipal battle with less than heroic figures

When Jacob's mother coolly condemns him for missing out on a chance for love

it sounds mean

but we all know she's right

Fedja van Huet plays Jacob as terrified but resolute against the bailiff

looking strangely like Robert Downey Jr

would if he starred in \"Cabinet of Dr

Caligari\"

Declair however

is a monster as Dreverhaven

even when his motives seem good

and he rules this flick

Character is incomplete

and yet unforgettable
