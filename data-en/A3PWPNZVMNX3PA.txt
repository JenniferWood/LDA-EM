One of Spielberg's best films

his next blockbuster as the follow-up to Jaws

Close Encounters

about a man (Dreyfuss) and a few others all have a calling to meet at Devil's Mountain where they will meet extra-terrestrials

Some of the best scenes full of intesity made whole with John Williams awesome score

The final scenes are some of the most memorable

and the best special effects you will see in modern cinema (comparatively so with CGI)

Spielberg also wrote the script

along with a cameo of famed French director Francois Truffaut
