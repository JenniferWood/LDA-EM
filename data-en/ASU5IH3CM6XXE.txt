Who likes this movie

How could you possibly make sense of a film like this

Steven Spielberg really messed up this time around

making a movie about space and yet most of it takes place on earth

Duh





what kind of science fiction movie takes place on Earth in the 1970s

This one

I guess

If you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs

then you'll love Close Encounters

And special effects

I don't know why they're considered so revolutionary because they're not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that's what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West

Apparently in Steven Spielberg's mind all space aliens are going to terrorize our planet after they arrive in a big Simon (complete with flashing colored lights and the annoying four musical notes)The best thing about this movie is that it ends (sadly after 6 1/2 hours of people climbing on mountains and staring into the sky)

Photosynthesis is more fun to watch than this movie

He's lost his skills since Star Wars
