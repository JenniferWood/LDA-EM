In the Company of Men is a strikingly original and intelligent film

As others have commented

the set design is thin

and the cinematography stark and

at times

a little bland

but these factors only provide a less obtrusive background for the real forces present on screen - dazzling peformances and a biting

at times hilarious

and at times heartbreaking

script

Eckhart's performance is sensational

He portrays a truly evil man of a frightening variety - he is not an idealogue

nor does he even care about committing cruel acts in the presence of an audience

He inflicts cruelty for very personal satisfaction

In fact

Eckhart is so good that you begin to question the real motives behind is behavior

and this ambiguity makes his final act with his victim even more troubling

Stacy Edwards is excellent as the victim

and

unlike a reviewer below

I found her both beautiful and strong

She is treated abhorrently

and the scene where she realizes the truth is searing

but she is a surivor

and a redemptive figure

Her treatment by Eckhart is all the more foreign because she is a wonderful

attractive person whose disability

which induces the practical joke in the first place

seems irrelevant

and even a source of unique strength by the film's end

Matt Malloy does well as the dupe - a man who has a few shreds of decency left under a coat of acceptance-seeking-at-any-cost fibers

He loses something that he can never recover in exchange for a few scraps of false manhood

The torture he feels by the film's end is achingly immediate

yet it is impossible to sympathize with or even pity him

This movie makes you think

and

if you watch it with others

debate

It is multi-layered

and

although not a thriller in the traditional sense

has more than enough emotional twists

Fantastic
