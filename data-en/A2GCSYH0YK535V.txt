There are four movies that serve as the pentultimate example of how to effectively utilize the comedic genius of Dan Aykroyd

a man who I will remain a stalwart fan of for all of my days

The movies are \"The Blues Brothers\"

\"Trading Places\"

\"Spies Like Us\" and of course

this film

\"My stepmother is an alien' is the tale of an astrophysicist(Aykroyd) who mistakenly penetrates an alien world when he sends a signal from his lab one stormy night

Soon

a beautiful denizen of that planet (Kim Basinger) arrives on earth in order to convince the scientist to send the signal again so that her world might be saved

The scientist



who is a lonely widower with a teenage daughter- falls in love with the sexy ET and marries her- thus the title

This is a fun movie

filled with top notch performances by its cast (Jon lovitz has an extremely funny early supporting role as Aykroyd's brother

and future Buffy alumnus Alyson Hannigan plays Aykroyd's daughter)

and a genuinely amiable wit

The key to the film is that director Richard Benjamin understands that he has DAN AYKROYD as his star

and he plays on that

Aykroyd demonstrates such energy in this film that his performance probably WAS picked up by an alien radio in a another galaxy

His character is immediately likeable

and he plays off of Basinger very well

As the title creature

Basigner is actually quite funny and charming

and the result is a fun little picture that may not set any new standards

but nonetheless delivers the goods with a solid one-two comedic punch

This is worth many repeat viewings
