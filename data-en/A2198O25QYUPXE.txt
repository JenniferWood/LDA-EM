A League of Their Own is an entertaining tribute to women's professional baseball

The fact that the women overcome some gender bias and provide a good brand of baseball

makes for enjoyable viewing

The film also dispenses some valuable insights regarding team bonding

and the impact that World War II had on the home front

and how baseball helped provide some normality to those who had loved ones at war
