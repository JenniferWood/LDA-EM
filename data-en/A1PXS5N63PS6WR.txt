I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale

I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered

This one

however

continues to be one of my all time favorites

The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story

Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man

also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power)

Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film

In my opinion

this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions

The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows

the settings and characters are well conceived

and the look of the film is faithful to the period

All in all an excellent holiday piece well worth the money
