When You watch the movie it has great acting however when you say loosely based on the Womens baseball league that is a understatement

This is true Hollywood fantasy and dumps historical accuracies in the trash

1925 - May 17

2010) was an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League player

She batted and threw left-handed

A native of Cincinnati

Kamenshek played outfield for a local softball league

and at the age of 17 she was spotted by a scout from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League

After tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago

she joined the Rockford Peaches as an outfielder when the league began in 1943

but was soon playing first base

She and short stop Snooky Harrell formed the league's best double-play combination

Kamenshek played in the AAGPBL for 10 seasons

and was selected as an All-Star all seven times the league established such a team

In 1946 she was the league's top batter with an average of

316 (a single point ahead of Audrey Wagner)

and won the distinction again in 1947 with an average of

306

She had no Hostile Jealous Sister because Dorthy (Dottie)was truly the BEST And Played 10 seasons not Just A Season
