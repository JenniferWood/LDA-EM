CHARACTER is all about tough love

Extremely tough

It is about family

In this instance

an extremely distant pair of parents and a young man seeking his identlty

It's also about great psychological drama

superior period design and unbelievably assured freshman filmmaking from director Mike Van Diem

It's also

as the title implies

about &quot;building character

&quot; The father

Dreverhaven

has some unusual character building techniques

to put it mildly

He at one point tells the young man's mother that he will strangle 9/10s of the life out of son Jacob

but the remaining 1/10ths will make him strong

And just for good measure

he may take the last tenth as welll

Jan Decleir

as Dreverhaven

is a revelation

He's built like Gerard Depardieu and is even more preposessing than that fine actor on screen

He would make a great Javert or Lear in some future production

Victor L&ouml;w

as Jacob's mentor and elder friend

De Gankeelar

is unlike anyone you will have seen on screen or stage

With an impossibly jutting jaw and unique mode of speech

he is the ultimate character actor

The entire cast is splendid

I'm not at all familiar with Dutch Cinema

and am not even entirely sure the term isn't an oxymoron

This film

however

can stand beside anything in contemporary cinema

Now I just have to dig up the novel by Ferdinand Borewijk

from which the movie was adapted

It's such a compelling story that I'm sure the novel will be excellent

as well

Five Stars and counting
