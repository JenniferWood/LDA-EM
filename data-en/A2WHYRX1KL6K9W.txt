To my surprise

I really enjoyed this movie a lot

There is a strong moral to this movie: Don't mess with mother nature

How many times does she have to teach man a lesson

Seems man is not a good listener

Not NEARLY as good as Godzilla vs

King Ghidorah

but the fight scenes are awesome and some of the characters are really amusing

Once again

the dubbing is bad









but that only adds to the entertainment

I think

&quot;Look

The flower talked

&quot; Haha that one kept me in stitches for a while

Not for everyone

especially non-Godzilla fans

Nuff said
