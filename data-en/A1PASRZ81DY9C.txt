a principal determined to make a change for the better while at the same time nobody knows what he is doing

It may not be pretty

but he gets results

The same goes for Lean on Me

Shame on anybody who saw this film and passed it by because this movie features the greatest performance of Morgan Freeman's career

Although he had done supporting work in Driving Miss Daisy

The Shawshank Redemption

Glory

Million Dollar Baby

Seven

and Unforgiven (think about that





this is an impressive list of movies he had been part of)

Morgan Freeman has never shined as bright as he did in Lean on Me

His performance carried the picture throughout and with the aid in direction of John G

Avildsen

who brought us none other than Rocky

Joe Clark

the character Morgan Freeman plays on Lean on Me

is one of the great characters where there is so much raw about him while he is portrayed ironically as a hero

no different than Oskar Schindler of Schindler's List

Lean on Me is so good that I could feel goose bumps every time I see it because of the thrilling scenes

the feelings that Morgan Freeman brings to his character

and the electrifying wavelengths that he sends to the rest of the cast

Lean on Me flowed naturally that it felt so real

Think about it





if Morgan Freeman wasn't casted as Joe Clark

would the movie have worked

I think not

Robert Guillaume was superb as Dr

Napier who shows that he is the real HNIC behind Joe Clark

Lean on Me is the film to be seen again and again

4/08: The king of school films

Lean on Me is a heartwarming tale based on a true story that happened in mid 80s and showcases an electrifying performance from Morgan Freeman

As I've seen Lean on Me countless of times

it's a film that never gets tiresome

In fact

the more I watch it

the more troublesome I get when deciding who was the best actor of 1989: Morgan Freeman of Lean on Me or Daniel Day-Lewis of My Left Foot along with Hugh O'Conor (who undeservingly got very little attention)

John G

Avildsen once again scores a masterpiece by creating an inspirational movie after his winning work Rocky

What is interesting about Lean on Me is how well the secondary feelings are brought out during Joe Clark's single-minded warpath

The others get hurt and voice out their feelings

That's why Lean on Me feels more human than often not

I remember seeing an absolutely stupid film called The Principal and then wanting to point out everything from Lean on Me that The Principal is not

When I love a film so much

it's usually hard to write a long essay

The same goes for Lean on Me

one of the best I've seen and is among my collection of favorites

3/12: Once again

Morgan Freeman is thrilling as Joe Clark and gives one of the best performances ever
