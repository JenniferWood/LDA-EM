Lean On Me was a great film

Morgan Freeman played an important role in this film

His acting was great

It's about this principal named Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) that goes into a new school and sees nothing but disaster caused by the students

But he is not angry at the students

He is angry at the staff

He always yells at the staff from the top of his lungs because they can't get the kids in line

The school board gives him one year to get his students to pass a required student state test

They should have passed the test years ago but the staff could not get them to pass it

But Joe Clark did

Joe Clark is not to happy about his staff

He even fires a few of them

It's like they just gave up on the school

But when Joe Clark comes along

everything changes

The swearing in this movie could have been a little less

but that is the only drawback

Buy this movie

you will be happy you did
