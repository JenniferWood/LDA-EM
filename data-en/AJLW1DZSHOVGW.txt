After reading \"First Flight - A Mother Hummingbird's Story

\" I was delighted to learn that during a three year period filmmakers Don and Noriko Carroll had patiently and lovingly captured Honey

a black-chin hummingbird

and her brood

two hatchlings \"the size of coffee beans\" on film

As Don Carroll explains in the featurette following the documentary

he and his wife

Noriko

were at an advantage of being able to capture such intimate and unimpeded footage of the hummingbirds because of the location of the nest - a clothesline out in the open

rather than in a tree which would have been much more difficult to film due to thickness of branches and leaves

winds and the difficulties in placing cameras in advantageous positions

In this film we actually view the movement inside the eggs of the future hatchlings

watch them puncture the first hole in the eggs

rest and then continue their pursuit to break through to their new lives

What is particularly moving is the attentiveness of their mother

Honey

as she watches over

nurtures and protects her two offspring

especially from the Carroll's family cat

Speaking of this cat

it's not just any cat

No

it is Birthday

stepping right out of the pages of another book of the Carrolls

\"Happy Birthday the Cat

\" which has some terrific photographs of this pretty feline

One in particular that I like is of Birthday sitting all alone on the shore of a California beach with the surf rolling in

How much she looks at home there

So it is wonderful after reading these two delightful books to see their subjects come alive on film

The cinematography is remarkable; Noriko Carroll's narration is gentle and informative

And don't miss the Slide Show feature for some breathtaking photographic stills of these wondrous birds
