This is yet another amazing Blu Ray disc

Perhaps better than the release prints

The sound in DTS surround (and Dolby Digital) is amazing as well

1977

That's hard to believe

All three versions of the film are here as well

You've no doubt seen the film and are interested in the transfer

It's quite simply amazing







Just get this one

It'll push your system to its limits
