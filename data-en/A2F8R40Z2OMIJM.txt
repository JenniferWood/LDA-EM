This is a great 2-disk set of one of my favorite Spielberg films

Actually

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of my all-time favorite films

The &quot;extras&quot; disk features some cut scenes that I've never seen

There is an excellent scene at the Neary's neighborhood barbeque where Roy (Richard Dreyfuss) must explain his half-suntanned face

Teri Garr does a wonderful job

Also

the documentary on this disk is incredible

It is much more thorough (and seems to be a longer version) than the one that was included on the recent VHS release

The film remains a classic

Some of the night scenes (especially on the country road set) look like they didn't transfer well (i

e

grainy and faded blacks)

And I'm not a fan of the 1980's &quot;inside the mothership&quot; ending

I'm glad it is gone on this version
