One of the most brutally subversive films of the 90s

and since its debut

I can still watch it time and time again

THAT'S the testament of a truly great film

Other people will say I'm nuts

but when you've been stuck watching 'Charlie's Angels&quot; or &quot;Armageddon&quot; for the upteenth time

and a film of substance comes along

you grab it with both hands

and don't let go

The production values are basically nil

It's a talky film with a mind to skewer both traditional roles of the antagonist/protagonist

and corporate America

and it succeeds brilliantly on both levels

Aaron Eckhart got an unbelieveable amount of hate mail following the release of this film

and I'm not suprised

Why this film didn't get the recognition it deserved is beyond me

Neil Labute's subsequent film &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbours&quot; is almost as good

and certainly worth owning

but this is the one the get

Absolutely essential
