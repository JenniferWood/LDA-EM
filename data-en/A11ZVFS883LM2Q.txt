I consider WKRP to be one of THE FUNNIEST TV shows EVER

It was the right cast at the right time and everything else about it was just





right

The only reason I titled my review

\"Almost Perfect\" is because in the versions of the show you see now

all the old rock music has been deleted and replaced with studio recordings of the songs by unknown artists or just bland anonymous music

If you saw the series when it aired in the 70s

it was true to what it was





a rock and roll radio station playing the big artists of the 70s

Thanks to the lawyers and greedy music companies

the original music that was in the series got surgically removed and replaced by what you'll hear now

Don't get me wrong





the show is still HILARIOUS

It's just not as perfect as it was when it originally aired

Hopefully at some point in the future

some smart cookie will release WKRP in its original form as it aired on CBS

This show should be up there with M*A*S*H and All in the Family so far as history goes

It's really THAT GOOD

From hearing Les Nessman describe live turkeys hit the pavement \"like bags of wet cement\" to Arthur Carlson slap his foot to wake it up because he thought he was putting on foot powder that turned out to really be cocaine

it's one funny episode after another

Don't bother renting the episodes that aired after they tried to revive the show in the 80s without Andy Travis and much of the original cast

It's like Caddyshack 2: a poor

poor attempt to recapture the magic of the original

The original episodes that aired in the late 70s are GOLDEN though

Rent 'em

buy 'em or whatever

Just be prepared to laugh and laugh a lot if you've never seen WKRP before or if you haven't seen it in a long time
