I would have to say that this is one of the best \"made-for-TV\" (on TNT) biblical films I've seen

The acting was phenominal

the scenery



EVERYTHING

This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible

which is pretty rare



almost unheard of in this day in age

It's a refreshing movie that has an honest

uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family

It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world

Even so

I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD

:)
