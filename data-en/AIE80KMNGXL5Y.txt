Words fail me in attempting to describe just how poor a movie In the Company of Men is

Aside from obvious flaws like the lack of a single compelling or sympathetic character

Men suffers from amateurish acting

a painfully bad script devoid of any wit or insight

and a frighteningly shallow and stilted portrait of men and male behavior

As bad a movie as you are likely to find anywhere
