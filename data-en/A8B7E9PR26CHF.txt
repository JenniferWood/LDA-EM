The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine

However

this is not the case with the American English dubbed version

Classic Media should've reconsidered cleaning up the American version as one may want to watch it as an alternative to reading and concentrating on the subtitles

Included on the dvd are features that are welcomed by die hard fans of Godzilla but personally I would've wanted interviews with stars of the film-giving their insights on the movie

experience in filming scenes etc

It especially would've been a treat if they were able to get an exclusive interview with the peanuts

In short

this should be in any Godzilla collection especially for completists
