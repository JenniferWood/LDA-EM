A young handsome albeit devilish business man persuades his associate to perform a cruel trick on a naive

lonely woman at work in order to break her heart

This is the premise for a film that studies men's cruelty and the nihilistic and absurd despair that fills the office room

often run by megalomaniacs

The film is a moral fable in many ways but so bleak and dark that many will not have the stomach for it

If you liked the theme of innocence being destroyed by evil as portrayed in the film The Last Seduction

then this film will probably work for you

But if rabid misogyny and gratuitous cruelty chafe at you too much

you might want to stay away
