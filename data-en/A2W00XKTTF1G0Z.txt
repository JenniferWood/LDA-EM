Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is the most intriguing films I have ever seen

It's filled with mystery

suspense

color and imaginationLet me discuss the DVD extra's first

There are many

It has two versions of the film

Several \"Making Of\" documentaries and the interviews with the original cast and crew

Including the then 5-year-old Drew Barrymore

The model making

lighting

location scouting and even the actual shooting of the scenes can be found here

Listening to Spielberg discuss almost every aspect of the making of this film is fascinating

And you get two versions of the movie

The one he originally cut and the theatrical release

For Sci-Fi fans the original version Steven cut is far more superior

This is a must DVD to have

The Collectors Edition is great and is worth watching over and over again

The story is simple but the action and mystery are almost magical

The ships

lights and colors are mesmerizing to the eye

All originally shot in an aircraft hanger

Wow
