Spielberg's awesome vision has finally made it to DVD and it was well worth the wait

Nice nuggets in the &quot;extras&quot; category

to be sure

But what's really gratifying

aside from the spectacular picture and sound quality

is that Spielberg chose to restore the film's original ending (without the silly boarding of the mothership)

Stunning filmaking throughout
