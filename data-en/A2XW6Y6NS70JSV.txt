I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected

I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it

It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small

uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean

They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie

but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance

I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie

As the film opens up

it just jumps into the story right away

beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle

likely just recently dropped in by parachute

The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there

We don't know and don't need to

The editing is done at a smooth

flowing

non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it

The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age

The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie

The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate

inspired and thoroughly believable

The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters

There are no subtitles

It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying

Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying

we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions

body language

and forcefulness of expression

Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real

giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real

soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal

After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival

they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island

My only grievance with this movie was its ending

I will not spoil it

but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates

Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself

The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars

Overall though

this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time

John Boorman

A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific

unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge

isolated setting

A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific

17 years later in 1985

this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'
