No doubt

legendary director Steven Spielberg will best be remembered for E

T

and SCHINDLER'S LIST

This UFO classic will always remain my favorite

The director's edition restores some scenes that were omitted when the special edition was released in 1980

and deletes the \"inside the mother ship\" scene

which I always felt was overkill

On a more personal note





in the days following September 11

2001

this was the film I finally came upon on TV after all those horrifying hours of 9-11 images

As I watched

I was suddenly 10 years-old again

seeing the movie for the first time at the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC

It didn't seem to matter that I had the uncut

unedited VHS tape on the shelf in front of me

I just kept watching it to the end

Thank you

Mr

Spielberg

for being the only evidence of any real magic in this world
