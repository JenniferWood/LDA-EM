This is a pretty neat latter day screwball romance comedy

The honcho who thought of casting Benicio Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone as potential lovers is either a genius or ready for the asylum

Regardless there is palpable chemistry between the two that produces kinetic sparks

A bonus is Christopher Walken as Silverstone's ambiguous Uncle Ray

You didn't really think a mere band of bikers could intimidate the Walkenator

did you

If there's a gripe to made is that the story is kind of thin

trite

and predictable

That said I'm not going to complain about a movie that has the gumption

for the most part to go the beat of its own quirky rhythms

It recalled to me films like \"Something Wild\" and \"True Romance\" that defied romance film convention
