I really loved this movie

it describes the biblical account pretty accurate

it starts w/ Joseph being sold to Egypt and backtracks after Joseph is accused from Potiphars wife

when Joseph defends himself in front of Potiphar through telling him his life story

I was clued to the screen the whole time

Also the actor for Joseph is very likable and also Jacob(Martin Landau) did a great performance
