I like the fact that Toho is releasing all there older Monster movies in a new dvd case

I look forward to seeing more of the movies being released so I can add them to my collection

One thing I would have liked to have seen with the movies being redone is to have the audio done in 5

1 dolby sound

than the standard audio format that they were originally done in
