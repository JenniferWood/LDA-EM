This is a terrific little independent film

filled with fascinating dialogue

fine acting (though a stronger actor than Matt Malloy would've helped bring \"Howard\" more to life)

and revealing cinematography

The story goes where it needs to

without regard to Hollywood convention

No happy ending here

In the big studio version

Billy Crystal would play Chad; Tom Hanks

Howard; and Meg Ryan

Christine

Chad would get his rightful comeuppance

and Howard and Christine would joyously unite in the end

Many reviews say this movie is about corporate greed

or male competition/anger

or whatnot

Sure

it has to do with those things

but ultimately those are sideshows

What many don't realize

but what's central to this quintessential story of the 1990s is that it's really an allegory about Bill Clinton

Newt Gingrich and their stormy relationship with American people

Chad

of course

is Clinton stripped down to an everyman mid-level executive; Howard is nothing more than Clinton's unwitting rival

Gingrich; and Christine

and Chad's live-in girlfriend

are nothing less than the voters

at once wooed

seduced

betrayed

and wounded by their erstwhile suitors

Howard

recently selected to head an important project just as Gingrich had recently become House Speaker

is in over his head-and heart-amid shark-infested waters

And who better to eat him alive than the honcho shark himself

Chad/Bill

Eager to please

confused about principles

lacking killer instincts

drunk on imagined power

and unable to discipline his emotions

Howard/Newt hasn't a chance against his ruthlessly conniving assassin

Meanwhile

Chad/Bill shamelessly wins over and destroys

yes

his Christine/Hillary/Gennifer/Monica/Juanita and

indeed

the entire company culture/American public

making them adore him for his alpha-male charms all the while he exploits and abuses them

Writer-director Neil LaBute has fashioned a political allegory of the highest order: One so subtle it scarcely intrudes into the intrinsic drama

yet powerful enough to define the politics of the '90s better than a whole bookshelf of political tomes

All the signs are there: It's no coincidence that the word \"chad\" acquired universal resonance after the 2000 Presidential election
