This is the most touching addaptation of the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; that I have ever seen

Masterfully created by Jim Henson (and featuring Kermit the Frog)

this story will touch everyone who sees it with it's characters

messages

music and humor

It is visually STUNNING and truly brings the spirit of Christmas home
