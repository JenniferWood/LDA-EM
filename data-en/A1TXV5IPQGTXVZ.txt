This is a fun miniseries featuring some of my favorite British actors

Michael Kitchen(The Hanging Gale

Foyle's War)

Francesca Annis (Cranford)

and Robson Green (Wire in the Blood)

The plot concerns a love triangle that is a bit different from the normal love triangle

For women of a certain age-ahem-it is a delightful situation to find a younger man chasing an older married woman

Perhaps this sounds like a soap opera but I can assure this series is so much more

The acting

the dialog and the laugh-out-loud antics of the principals make this a wonderful way to spend an afternoon

I have loaned this set to friends and they

too

have enjoyed it

I recommend this series highly
