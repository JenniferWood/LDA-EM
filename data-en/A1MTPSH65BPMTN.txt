This one doesn't quite rank up there with \"Coach Carter

\" but it is of the same ilk

Based on actual events

it is the story of what seems to be lacking in our society today - guts

honor

courage

and a conviction to doing what we know to be right and true

Morgan Freedom does a good job - it's not one of his best - the performance lacks some of the subtleties that his later performances carry so beautifully; but

it is a stirring story

nonetheless

It is certainly worth seeing and learning from
