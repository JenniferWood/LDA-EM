What I like about the Blu-Ray Essentials edition is that it includes all 3 versions of the film at a great price; plus

there's a feature that tells you which scenes were added or deleted in the special edition and final director's cut of the movie

The restoration isn't as perfect as the other big sci-fi movie that came out in the summer of '77 (Star Wars)

but it's a good transfer

The movie itself is a classic

I watched the original version with my 7-year-old

He was disappointed that the movie didn't show the inside of the mothership

so I showed him that scene from the 1980 re-release

He was underwhelmed

as were we all

CE3K

I think

was the last Spielberg movie that felt like real life

His movies became a lot slicker in the '80s
