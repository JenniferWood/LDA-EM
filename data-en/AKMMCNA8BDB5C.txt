As most movies

this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out

it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph

his family and those he met in Egypt

A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)
