The tape quality is the main reason I'm not giving this a five-star review

The dubbing is absolutely horrendous

and the tape's really bad (why not letterbox

And what's with the grainy picture

) Not TriStar's best efforts

And a final gripe: why change the title

It's &quot;Godzilla vs

Mothra

&quot; not &quot;Godzilla and Mothra: the Battle For Earth

&quot;Lousy tape quality aside

this is an okay movie

The plot is slow at times

but the FX are surprisingly good

especially the laser light shows

The monsters look cool

especially Battra

Fans of the giant monster movie genre will get a kick out of this one
