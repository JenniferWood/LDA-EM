Having what was considered the best Godzilla suit of the Showa series

it also had one of the best stories and monster battles done in the 60's

Here was the first real time Godzilla was hinted at as being an unstopable force of nature that man just was not destined to stop

let alone kill

This film also is the lead-up to the next movie of the series - Gehdorah

Get both as they are both a great buy as well a great films

Love the Mastwork packaging

wish they all were
