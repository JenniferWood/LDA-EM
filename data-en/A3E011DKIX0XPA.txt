I watched it at school

and everyone in my class was either sleeping or scratching their heads in confusion

I just don't understand why Spielberg made this movie





along the way

people started talking in random languages (pardon me for being vague

I don't remember WHICH languages) and

well





it was just weird

Why did they

I have no idea

The ending just baffled me





*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship

HUH

Maybe I was just having a bad day

but it really made no sense to me

I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'

Quite a poor effort

conclusively





this movie was weak
