A beautifully photographed and detailed period film that is

unfortunately

very slow moving

It really isn't until the final moments that things begin to pick up and the \"mystery is finally solved\"

One of the main problems is that the motivations of the \"Bad Guy\" aren't really clear

and this kind of jumbles things up

Unless you have a lot of time on your hands

and are a very patient viewer

this subtitled film will not satisfy
