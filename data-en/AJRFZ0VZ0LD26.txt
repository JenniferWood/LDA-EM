Although this film has been around for 10 years

I never got a chance to see it until now

Originally

description of the movie was about two men on the business trip playing a crude

scheming seduction game on a vulnerable

deaf woman

Now that I have seen the film

it is so much more that what a short blip about the film weants you to believe

This film is about perfidity of seduction as much as it is about false friensdhips

corporate coldbloded fight for power

getting ahead of other people by any means possible
