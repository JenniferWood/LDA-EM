Great special effects are of course of value in science fiction but here the draw is really the characters

I felt invested in each of the main characters and wanted to keep watching

The music was haunting and well planned

adding wonderfully to the atmosphere of the story

Might be too frightening for young children but not boring to non-science fiction fans since the focus is on what drives and pushes the characters
