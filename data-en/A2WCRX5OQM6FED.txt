During his glory days

Jean-Claude Van Damme was somewhat of a vehicle for Hong Kong directors wanting to break into the American film market: previously

he had saddled the freshman outings ofCorey Yuen

John Woo

and laterTsui Hark

While those directors were mostly interested in what they could get out of the Muscles from Brussels in terms of guns

car chases

and karate

Ringo Lam ofCity on Fireand \"Maximum Risk\" here seemed more intent on developing Van Damme beyond his action hero image via a step into the thriller genre

Whether he was successful is a matter of opinion

but it's unquestionable that this film is one of the most mature outings from this stage in our hero's career and definitely one of his most entertaining and interesting

The story: when French policeman Alain Moreau (Van Damme) uncovers the death of a twin brother he never knew existed

he assumes his identity to uncover the reason behind his death and his underworld connections in America

The script by Larry Ferguson (writer ofThe Hunt for Red Octoberand definitely one of the more respected people to pen a Van Damme movie) places storytelling over action setups and

in general

feels a bit smarter than the average Van Damme vehicle

There isn't any real mystery to the story

though: the revelation of Alain's brother and his affiliation with the Russian mafia is dealt with without too much buildup

and the story begins to revolve around Alain retreading his brother's unsuccessful steps to distance himself from the mob and escape from corrupt FBI agents

His relationship with his brother's old flame (Natasha Henstridge

Species) is interesting at first but is then more or less dropped into your lap

Nevertheless

the movie never loses a sense of suspense: Alain doesn't seem quite as empowered as other characters Van Damme was playing at the time

so it rarely seems impossible that he could be killed

Soundly-weighed production values by director Lam help set a good mood and the art direction is

at times

inspired

While the film's not built on it

the action content soundly supplements the package

Shootouts

car demolitions

and some on-foot chases are all fun enough

but it's the hand-to-hand fights that really catch your eye

This was arguably the first film in which Van Damme moved away from flashy karate moves and indulged in a slightly more realistic style of fight scene - inclusive of plenty of gritty brawling and grappling - and he couldn't have had a better opponent than vale tudo champion Stefanos Miltsakakis

Though their rematch inDerailedwas a disaster

their three encounters here are among the few instances in movies wherein MMA-esque fighting isn't a bore to watch

The battle in an elevator is especially entertaining and features brutal close-quarters choreography that wouldn't be matched until theBournemovies

The film features a pretty good cast

including Jean-Hugues Anglade (Betty Blue) as Alain's partner and David Hemblen (Exotica) in a limited role as the leader of the Russian mafia

but the unexpected dramatic moment of the picture belongs to Van Damme for a surprisingly adept instance of silent acting near the end of the movie wherein Alain listens to a recorded message by his late brother

Ringo Lam would continue to bring a little something extra out of Jean-Claude in the future

even directing him to his first-ever dramatic award nomination five years later

but \"Maximum Risk\" is probably the most palatable of all their collaborations for its all-around strengths and mainstream appeal

Van Damme fans can't go wrong
