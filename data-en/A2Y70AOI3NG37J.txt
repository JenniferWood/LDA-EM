First the bad: The photographers and the director of this movie were sleeping and in their place they found a bunch of kids with ADD and gave them the cameras

Well that is my theory because of all the Godzilla films this movie has the worst fight scenes

They are analogous to a adult movie when the camera in the middle of the action goes and focuses in on the guy;s butt

Basically when Godzilla was fighting Mothra we saw one random part of Godzilla moving then another part moving then switch over to Mothra and see a part of Mothra moving

All in all it was what made this movie not get a good rating

Now the Good: The movie was hilariously ironic

Let's say that the evil Happy Enterprises happened to return the egg to Mothra's Island

well then Japan would have been doomed

So maybe evil businesses are capable of good in the long run

Also Happy Enterprises is probably one of the greatest names for a business

All the dialouge was classic

Where did the twins come from; nobody knows

Also the movie shows a strong anti-nuke message in a not so subtle way

For example the characters on the ravaged island say \"this island is reason enough to stop nuclear testing

\" HINT HINT

The plot like all other Godzilla movies was full of holes and it is also obvious that the Japanease military never learns that tanks are worthless against Godzilla

For all the Godzilla fans this is a must have

but for the casual viewer pick up a different video
