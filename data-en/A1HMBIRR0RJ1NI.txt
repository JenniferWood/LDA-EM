5 Stars = Masterpiece\"Hell in the Pacific\" is one of the greatest movies of it's ilk

Can't even begin to remember the first time I watched it

most likely not long after it was made

A true portrait of two men fighting a war on opposite sides

that only know their on opposite sides

but find out what it is to know your opponent

who may not necessarily be your enemy

Essential veiwing
