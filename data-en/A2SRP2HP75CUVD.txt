After his giant battle with King Kong

the monster known as Godzilla returns

Only this time

he's up against a giant moth who's preventing him from attacking more civilians

In 1964

the Toho Company released the fourth movie in the Godzilla series

\"Mothra vs

Godzilla

\" Known in the United States as \"Godzilla Vs

The Thing

\" the film was a product of the celebrated creative team of Shinichi Sekizawa (screenplay)

Ishiro Honda (human drama)

and Eiji Tsuburaya (special effects)

Mothra Vs

Godzlla is known by fans everywhere as \"Godzilla's finest hour

\" for its good sound effects

tone and script

It's also the most popular and memorable film in the franchise

Mothra Vs

Godzilla is widely considered to be the best of all the sequels

Watching it again after so many years

I find that statement to be very true

This is one of the best Godzilla movies out there

If you want to see Godzilla in his prime

then this is the movie you have watch; for it truly is his finest hour

After a giant typhoon hits Tokyo

a news reporter named Sakai and his photographer Junko take pictures of the damage

Later that same day

the local villagers discover a giant monster egg washed ashore on the beach

The villagers salvage it and scientists come to study the egg

No one knows whose egg it is and where it came from

While Sakai and Junko try to ask Professor Miura questions about the egg

an entrepreneur of Happy Enterprises named Kumayama scurries the scientists off and explains that he bought the egg from the local villagers

Instead of letting scientists study the egg

Kumayama wants to make it apart of a tourist attraction

Kumayama wants to make more cash by having customers pay to see the giant egg hatch

Sakai

Junko

and Professor Miura are disgusted by the idea and believe that Kumayama has no right to keep the egg

As Kumayama discusses the tourist attraction with his boss

they are visited by two tiny twin girls

The two girls explain that they are from Infant Island and that the egg belongs to a monster named Mothra

The twins later leave with nothing after pleading with the two men on giving the egg back

The twins then turn to the newspaper journalists for help

but still fail

Later

Sakai

Junko

and Professor Miura then go out testing for radioactivity in an industrial area

That's when Godzilla suddenly pops out of the beach (where he supposedly left off after his fight with King Kong) and begins to attack the surrounding cities

With very little hope that the military will defeat Godzilla

another reporter suggests that the friendly Mothra might be able to get rid of the monster

Sakai

Junko

and Professor Miura then head to infant island to warn the villagers that Mothra's egg might be in danger

resulting in a climatic battle between Mothra and Godzilla

This was one of the many Godzilla movies I remembered watching as a kid

Back then I was always fascinated with Godzilla

so I was pretty heart broken to see him defeated at the hands of Mothra's babies

I was young at the time

so I wasn't as into the story

I always figured that Godzilla was a good guy

so I was really ticked off when I first saw this movie

It wasn't until I got older that I realized Godzilla was the bad guy

In fact

the early movies presented Godzilla as a menace

A punishment for the sins of World War 2

A result from the fallout of a hydrogen bomb test

A giant fire breathing villain with a sweet tooth for destruction (alright you get the idea)

The other monster in the movie

Mothra

is actually a nice creature

A sort of \"love\" monster if you will

This film marks the first appearance of Mothra in the Godzilla series

Mothra would later appear in many other Godzilla films

Mothra Vs

Godzilla is one of the key movies in the Godzilla franchise

due mostly to its popularity

It's one of my all time favorite monster movies

It has a great story

a good cast of characters and a great script

It's top notch compared to many other films in the series

If this isn't already in your collection then you should be ashamed of yourself

Mothra Vs

Godzilla is a must own for monster movie and Godzilla buffs alike

Much like the previous re-releases

Genius Products attached both the original Japanese-language and English-dubbed versions of the movie

As always

the Japanese cut of the movie is better (and less confusing)

Once again it's not jam packed with bonus material

but there is a commentary track and \"Akira Ifukube biography\" featurette

If you're looking for a great monster movie then look no further

The Toho Master re-release of Mothra Vs

Godzilla is one that you must have in your collection
