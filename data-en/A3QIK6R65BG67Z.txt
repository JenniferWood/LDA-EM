Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune are the only characters in this rather unique film

Sworn World War II enemies

they find themselves marooned on a desert island together

The story moves along

as the American and the Japanese gradually learn to mistrust one another less and less

Even though neither can make himself fully understood to the other

they finally manage to construct a raft together and sail to a different island

formerly occupied by Japanese military

but now abandoned

Unless the viewer happens to understand Japanese

the only person whose dialogue can be followed is Marvin's

This is no matter

because one can get the jist of each situation quite easily

Dubbing in subtitles would have been utterly stupid

not being needed at all

What this amounts to is a low key anti-war story

It also features two alternative endings

the first tragic

the second much the opposite

It's worth watching
