I agree with a review that Roger Ebert gave Your Friends and Neighbors

which was

it was like Quinten Tarantino's Pulp Fiction to his Reservior Dogs

This film is a singular work

not on the scope of Your Friends and Neighbors

and not as good

Some scenes were very good and entertaining

and because of that

surely deserves to be watched

Hopefully if it goes on sale even more

At 20 dollars it would be a good buy

However

I did not find myself drawn into the failures of the characters as much as I was hoping for

So I find myself having to give it 3 stars
