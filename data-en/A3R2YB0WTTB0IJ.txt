I consider Francis Coppola as one of the five best directors of the last 30 years

Even in his less successful movies

there is still the sparkle of the genius

And ONE FROM THE HEART which was a huge flop

critical and popular

is

in my opinion

a masterpiece

along with APOCALYPSE NOW and THE GODFATHER

part I

II and III

Now why would Francis Coppola be interested in the screenplay of PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED

a light and nostalgic comedy about life and its disenchantments

Perhaps the subject touched him because of the recent fall of Zoetrope Studios which

at this time

was falling apart with Coppola's dreams and money

In this perspective

PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED is a formidable statement of a bleeding director : &quot; If I could live again now

knowing what I know

I won't change a thing

&quot;

Speaking of perspective

let's observe that there aren't any mirrors in the real world of Peggy Sue

Coppola choosing to shoot the back of another actress when Kathleen Turner faces her mirror

This creates an uneasiness in the audience because we have the impression that Peggy Sue will jump out of the mirror

Great idea of an always innovative director

You will have understood that PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED is a movie you can watch several times and still discover another little pearl hidden in it

That's cinema

And I like it this way
