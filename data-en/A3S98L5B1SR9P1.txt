Lost in the hype around Star Wars

this gem of a movie is the smart man's \"sci-fi\" film

Superbly written and acted

featuring Spielberg's favorite everyman in Richard Dreyfuss who sees lights in the night sky

He can't explain it and against the wishes of those around him

feels compelled to investigate this frustrating enigma that becomes clear

Featuring powerhouse special effects and awesome score by John Williams

This is the movie that makes you think: ARE WE ALONE
