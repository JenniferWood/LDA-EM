This is another of those films-I-think-I'm-not-going-to-like-that-my-son-forces-me-to-watch at Christmastime

And

as usual (but not always)

he is right

The elegant production and cinematography capture the look of 1840-ish Paris

Some of the scenes are quite moving

actually

Liam Neeson (if one doesn't do the story's math) is convincing in the role of Jean Valjean (reminding me of Gerard Depardieu); Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as the relentless Javert; and Uma Thurman is properly consumptive as the dying Fontine (I also thought she was remarkably good in the role)

As for Cosette and Marius

they are lovely to look at

The pomp of the funeral procession is splendid

and the violence at the barricades is compelling

If the movie does not capture every moment of the book (which I did read in school)

well

neither does Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" capture every line of \"Le Roi S'Amuse

\" This production of \"Les Miserables\" is nevertheless good on its own terms: It captures the essence of Hugo's tale of wretchedness

revolution; recognition and redemption admirably

Moreover

it captured my interest for a couple of hours

Not every movie nowadays does so
