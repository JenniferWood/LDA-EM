I have never understood what people saw in this nonsense

Richard Dreyfuss portrays a complete ass who abandons his family on an idiotic whim - this is a hero

What does he accomplish

Nothing

The movie is well filmed and produced but to me it is like covering an aging hooker with makeup and pretending you have anything other than an old hooker
