Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic

One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy

The general feel of this movie

though

is grey

That's the best way to describe it

But then

it was a bleak grey time in American history

with the Great Depression and all

When Dickens originally wrote the book

it was a grey time in England's history as well

so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story

A nice twist (sorry

Oliver

) to a true classic

By the way

for my money

the finest original version out there is the George C

Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim
