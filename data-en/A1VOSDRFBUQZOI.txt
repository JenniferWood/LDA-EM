A pair of greedy guys exploit an egg that has washed ashore in the circus

Sure enough

Mothra's tiny twins the Shobijin

come to Japan and warn them that the egg is Mothra's and if it hatches it might destroy Tokyo

Sure enough Godzilla comes and makes a big mess of Japan

And the natives of Mothra's island refuse to send Mothra over to help

Then who will defeat Godzilla

Tape is letterboxed

Dubbing is OK but the dialogue is garbled and kinda hard to make out

SPFX by Eiji Tsuburaya is top notch
