Why is Chad so frightening

Because Society is full of Chads

Around every corner there is some version of Chad: a cruel

unscrupulous

good-looking

highly intelligent person along his lines

who will not only NOT get what's coming to him

but through guile

hypocrisy and ruthlessness rise and devour

In addition

elements of Chad exist in almost everyone

male or female

which if given a chance to operate without personal cost

will always tend to assert themselves to RULE and EXPLOIT the weak

In a Hollywood movie Chad would've ended up ruined for his evil deeds while the Hollywood Chads behind the scenes collected a fat profit laughing their heads off at the naivete of the public

In LaButte's Indie film Chad gets it all

beautiful woman

position and sadistic kicks without any personal cost whatever

&quot;In the Company of Men&quot; is not a 'great' film by any means

but an especially important one nevertheless

LaButte and Eckhart's fully realized `white collar' villain commemorates

for easier identification

the readily sensed but rather vague `evil techniques' of countless Chad-type predators throughout society

Future victims of Chads now possess a secret weapon; and not only that

the Chadlike elements present within every person will

for anyone who has seen this film

find it harder to assert themselves without complex and ever more evasive rationalizations
