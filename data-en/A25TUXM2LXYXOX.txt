The fourth film of the Heisei series lacks the complexity and seriousness of the previous entries

It is

however

light-hearted fun that is extremely enjoyable

The spfx are excellent

except for Mothra who pales in comparison to Eiji Tsubaraya's classic creation

Battra looks good and is suitably mean and ill-tempered

The Big G is powerfully rendered and played with absolute believability by suitmation actor Ken Satsuma

Koichi Kawakita does excellent work throughout



though his handling of the film's final battle does not compare well to Tsubaraya's work on the original G

vs Mothra

The plot

though heavy-handed

moves along quickly

The actors

including classic-era actor Akira Takarada

are uniformly engaging

Once again

Akira Ifukube contributes a perfect score

G

and Mothra may not be the best of the new G series but it is still a very good sci-fi film for all ages
