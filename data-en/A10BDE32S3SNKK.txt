Godzilla vs

Mothra is probably one of Godzilla's best face off movies

Even though the movie sounds kind of weird thinking of Godzilla battling a giant Moth is kind of stupid

There is a reason why Godzilla vs

Mothra is considered by many as one the greatest

this is the movie that established just how indestructible Godzilla really is to convectional weapons

The film also has what I call the Godzilla Theme when Godzilla makes his appearence in the film

When the film came out in America it was called Godzilla vs

The Thing

That has to be one the dumbest dubbed titles I have ever heard

Godzilla vs

Mothra is way better by a mile
