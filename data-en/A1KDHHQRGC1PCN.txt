FINALLY





this and GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN/GIGANTIS have been released

well

widely as opposed to just the Godzillaondvd website as they had been for awhile

There's not much to say about the plot

nor do I care to do plots on Amazon

lard knows there's about a million people rehashing the plots over and over here (or is this IMDB

hehe;-)

so the product itself:CASE: Like the GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN/GIGANTIS set that was released on the same day

this one

though it looks thicker in photos and like a silvery mate to the 2 disc GOJIRA set that came out

these are thinner being only one disc

no spine/hub like that one

MOTHRA: (and this applies to Gigantis

see my review for that one as well)

the case is fairly thick cardboard





much like a book

overlayed with the silvery graphics

This is well done

and a treat for those of us who appreciate the super crowded Japanese packaging designs

When you take off the plastic from the store the case crackles open like a new book to reveal the trayed disc on one side (the right) which is a rather dull affair considering the design of everything else

but it's functional

being only title graphics

To the left being an oft-seen shot of Godzilla shooting his breath at Mothra

The cover speaks for itself being just a well executed piece of graphics featuring the poster art as its base

especially for DVD's which are usually nothing spectacular in my book

so kudos for creating such a cool looking package

This said

the downside of this is the case does not snap closed

Most 'book' style cases snap shut

but being that there's no other tray save for the disc tray to click into

this case will eventually weaken and not stay shut

so purchasers are advised to keep the paper band that rides on the outside of the case

And in this or RAIDS AGAIN

there is no booklet

PRINTS: The prints are decent and certainly a HUGE step above the Classic Media release from a few years back that many of us already have (bright yellow with Mothra superimposed in the middle)

It doesn't hurt that these are in anamorphic widescreen which was a treat since the other was a 4x3 and a pain to watch on a widescreen TV for obvious reasons

Without a doubt

the print here could've been cleaned up/repaired

but it is still quite nice to watch all points considered

For some reason

since it wasn't beaten over my head that these were going to be outstanding fresh-as-yesterday-prints

I'm more than willing to not complain

It's also a Godzilla film

which deserve good treatment

but I'm not going to expect a CASABLANCA or WIZARD OF OZ restoration









at least in this lifetime









especially if it wasn't such a focused point as was done with the GOJIRA release









which when we got it

was kind of a mess

The JP version runs 88:36

and the US runs 88:07

EDIT: I feel compelled to add

before anyone screams at me for not recognizing these are 'restored' prints

well







scratches

genral wear and jumps are still just that









'restored' or not













it's still not 'restored' to the original condition

So there





;-)COMMENTARY: I hafta admit

between this and the RAIDS AGAIN commentaries

I've had the most enjoyable experience with the 'medium' (do commentaries count as a medium

)

They are really informative

especially if you are not a full-on Godzilla academic like myself

It could be complained that they are oftimes dry and book read

but who else is gonna sit there for two hours and do this kind of stuff free-form

I enjoyed this commentary alot

The two hosts played off of each other quite well

and most importantly

they didn't come off as pretentious

though in a couple spots

the comments about the 'realism' of the scenes involved was a teeeeeeeny bit of an enthusiastic stretch







lol

I like commentaries on the rare occasions I watch with them on

when they don't beat me over the head with how wonderful everything is on the screen

These two are a good example of this





enthused but not over the top (KING KONG '33 commentary anyone

)

They recognize the film's faults for what they are and the good points as well

A simple concept

but I've turned off quite a few gushing commentaries because the commentators devolved into gushing fanboys

OVERALL: EXCELLENT RELEASE

This is defintiely a keeper and does not feel like a cheap stand-in like the original release of this title here in the US

That one always felt like it may as well have been a cheapie bootleg sitting on the shelf

This is finally the decent release I'd been wanting

And can't wait for the next titles from this company
