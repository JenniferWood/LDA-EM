I vividly remember seeing \"CE3K\" as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote \"We are not alone

\"

Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about

This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most overated films

It resembles a tv mini-series

long and plodding

and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions

I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it

As with many early Spielberg films

there are lots of noisy

irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia

After a long hour and a half

these people finally make it to Devil's Tower

where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans

This sequence is still dazzling

but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show

And

oh yes

that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie

I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well

There is a highly noticable \"shimmering\" in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents

Also

the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks

Many scenes were \"soft\" and uneven

The bonus disc

however

is very nice and contains great interviews and a documentary about the making of the film
