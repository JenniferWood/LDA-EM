I was really surprised how well this film held up

A marvelous movie with marvelous DVD extras

Don't be surprised if the ending is different than you remember

This is actually the ORIGINAL ending to the film

not the ending that Spielberg was persuaded to put on the &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-release of the movie

The other ending is contained in the special features

if you miss it
