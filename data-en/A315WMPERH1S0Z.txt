THE YOUNG IN HEART is an unusual comedy from the 1930's

Produced by the legendary David O

Selznick

it's a warm-hearted picture of a family of con-men who worm their way into the good graces of an lonely elderly woman living on an estate in hopes of becoming her heirs

The movie is charming but I actually didn't find it that funny

yet it is very enjoyable

Character actress Minnie Dupree steals the show in a gentle

non-hammy performance as the lonely senior - incredibly

this is one of only four films she made

the other three being rather minor efforts

Janet Gaynor and Douglas Fairbanks Jr

are the nominal stars of the picture as the children of Roland Young and Billie Burke

all of them experts in swindling

Gaynor and Fairbanks' scenes are so unusually playful one suspects their being siblings is just another con (it's not)

Young and Burke are in fine form as the prententious father and dizzy mother (\"Oh

my little girl has a birthday this year

too

\")

Fairbanks is quite believable as a non-malicious cad but while I love Janet Gaynor and she's by far my favorite star of the cast

she is not very credibly cast as a professional crook

her natural sweetness and good nature just gets in the way although she does give a fine performance

I was most impressed with Richard Carlson (film debut) playing Janet's beau

the young American star speaks in a most credible Scottish brogue

This was also one of Paulette Goddard's first films - cast as Fairbanks' girl - she is third-billed but doesn't appear in the first 40 minutes of this 91 minute movie

This was Janet's last film as a star - she retired after it's release and returned to the screen only once in 1957 in a secondary role in a Pat Boone musical

The movie is a bit on the cute side with puppies

penguins

and sweet old ladies but what's wrong with that

The print quality is excellent on this DVD

Also want to note Amazon shows the DVD cover as picturing Fairbanks and Paulette Goddard

Maybe somebody at MGM DVD didn't realize it wasn't Janet - this has apparently been corrected in later copies - my copy shows a picture of Janet in place of Paulette while Douglas remains where he was
