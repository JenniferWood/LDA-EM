I admit it: I'm not a Richard Dreyfuss fan

I have only really liked him in two movies -- George Lucas' American Grafitti and Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind

Until recently

I had only seen bits and pieces of Spielberg's 1977 UFO classic

I never had the time or inclination to sit down and watch the whole movie

That is

until my current boyfriend (a true Spielberg aficionado) purchased the Collector's Edition DVD

We sat down in my living room and watched it

What surprised me about Spielberg's film is how well the story of a peaceful encounter between humanity and a spacefaring civilization is told

Not only are the 1977 special effects still effective

but the human interest part of Close Encounters was compelling

As seen mostly from the point of view of Indiana electrical engineer Roy Neary (Dreyfuss)

the movie depicts the mystery and wonder of how we discover that we are not alone in this universe

It shows that even though Neary loses almost everything to the compulsion mysteriously implanted into his mind

he eventually finds that his sacrifices were worth it

The movie is never boring

Instead

even though it's not a film like Star Wars with ray guns and explosions

it's fast-paced and interesting

It takes its cues from actual UFO sightings and other unexplained mysteries (such as Flight 19

the 5-plane training flight that disappeared off the coast of east Florida in December of 1945) and ends up with a realistic scenario for a &quot;close encounter&quot; between humans and aliens

The acting is excellent

and the young Spielberg got great performances not only from Dreyfuss

but also from Teri Garr (Veronica Neary)

Melinda Dillon (Gillian Guiller)

Francois Truffaut (Lacombe) and Gary Guffey (Barry)

Also adding to the magic was composer John Williams

whose 5-note musical phrase became famous as the proof that music is truly a universal language

The two-disc collector's edition includes the movie in wide screen format

with a second disc that contains a making-of documentary

eleven deleted scenes

plus theatrical trailers

Both picture and sound are excellent and considering it's a two-DVD set

the price is affordable

I give this movie a strong endorsement
