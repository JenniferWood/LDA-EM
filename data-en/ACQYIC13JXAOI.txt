RecklessOkay

I admit to being more than a little prejudiced here

I absolutely LOVE this DVD

Even ten years on

it has all the charm

drama and poignancy of the first showing on Masterpiece Theatre

It's the story of young Owen Springer

a cheeky (and sexy) doctor transferred to a Manchester hospital who falls in hopelessly love with an older woman (Francesca Annis) who just happens to be his boss's wife

Steller performances by Green

Annis

Michael Kitchen

David Bradley

Julian Tutt-Rhind and Connor Mullen take this comedy/romance/satire to a new level of entertainment

Don't miss it or the sequel

also on this 4-disc boxed set
