The DVD image quality is excellent

I didn't expect much at the budget price

so the sharp

stable

colorful 2

35:1 widescreen transfer was a nice surprise

The box says &quot;images of superb quality taken from the film's original print

&quot; It's usually best to ignore puffery

but here you really do get gorgeous video--about as good as (say) the Bond DVDs of the same vintage

Minor nits: there's some dust at the ends of the reels

and the widescreen transfer is not anamorphic (that is

not &quot;enhanced for 16:9 TVs&quot;)

The 5

1 audio is choppy and strange at times

Whenever the dubbed English pops in

the sound quality changes

almost as if it briefly drops into mono

But part of the joy of vintage Godzilla is its glorious cheezyness

Making it too sterile would cut out its soul

The DVD &quot;extras&quot; are negligible

At the price

it's unfair to complain about this

The important thing is that the film itself looks great

If you like Godzilla

don't hesitate
