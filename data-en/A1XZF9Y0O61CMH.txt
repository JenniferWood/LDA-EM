The series are amazing

Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the Lord God as foundation

I was expecting those usual blurry versions

but this is entirely different

Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family

The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy

anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory

Watch it
