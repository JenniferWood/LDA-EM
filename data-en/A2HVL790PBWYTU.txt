1988'sStand And Deliverand 1989's Lean On Me were two feel-good movies concerning our besieged educational system that left an indelible impression on me back in the day

They're stories made even more riveting by virtue of that they're based on real events and actual people

Stand and Deliver triumphantly stands the test of time; it's one of my favorite movies ever

But Lean On Me











tells the story of \"Crazy Joe\" Clark

In 1987

Eastside High of Paterson

New Jersey is as low down as it could get

The state report ranks Eastside High last in the state

Drugs and firearms and scholastic ennui run rampant in Eastside

The teachers have lost all control

A bill has just passed mandating that 75% of the students must pass the minimum basic skills test or

else

the state takes control by the end of the school year

Sad thing is

the year prior

only 38% of the students passed the minimum basic skills test

The mayor (Alan North) of Paterson is fuming mightily

not because he cares all that much about book learnin' but mostly because he's up for re-election

He needs someone to step into inner-city Eastside High and take charge

He needs someone with nothing to lose

Dedicated but combative teacher Joe Clark has burned bridges everywhere he's went

Today he's exiled as an elementary school principal

When a former colleague (a very good Robert Guillaume) approaches Joe with an offer to preside over Eastside

well

it means that

among other things

director John G

Avildsen's found himself another underdog vehicle to champion

To me - or rather

to an earlier me - Joe Clark and Stand and Deliver's Jaime Escalante seemed like two educators cut from the same cloth

It wasn't 'til repeated viewings did it dawn on me that while Escalante was fierce and demanding

Joe Clark was straight-up angry and resentful

Escalante exhibited unexpected warmth

Since we're not mincing words

Joe Clark proved to be a dictatorial tool

The subversive truth is that this incarnation of Joe Clark is a bully

a martinet disdainful of his staff's feelings and opinions

You root for him early on as he arrives at Eastside - as he steps into that \"cauldron of violence\" - and as he promptly lays down the law

His first administrative act as new principal is to expel 300 of the school's worst student offenders

He informs his teachers that \"This is not a damn democracy

We are in a state of emergency

and my word is law

\" To quote one admiring student: \"Mr

Clark don't play

\" Right on

\"Crazy Joe

\"As the film goes on

we wait for him to thaw out

to become a more sympathetic character

But he doesn't get there

not really

If you've gotten used to Morgan Freeman as this amiable elderly statesman

only put this movie on to realize how fiercely this guy can chew scenery

Freeman is sensational and is at his most showy

stomping around and having hissy fits and deploying the most malevolent death stare since the Sonny Liston era

Whether he's chaining up all entry points to Eastside (to prevent the bad elements from sneaking in) or intimidating his students into learning the school song (and we get an unexpected

fantastic singing scene out of that) or whether slugging an armed juvie

\"Crazy Joe\" Clark intends to turn Eastside High around even if it means terrorizing and alienating everyone around him

So we laud him for his unorthodox disciplinary efforts even as we condemn him for being too harsh a taskmaster and for his unwillingness to bend

for his unshakeable belief that he's infallible

How can you teach when you yourself are unteachable

Lean on Me has relevance and I recommend it for Morgan Freeman's ferocious performance and for the film's sometimes harrowing peek into inner-city truths and for the occasional comic flourish

If you can distill the movie down to one scene

it's that one where Joe Clark is on the roof and dropping real talk on Sams

a young hooligan pleading for a second chance

When it takes someone as abrasive and intractable as Joe Clark to turn things around - Joe Clark who

when being coaxed by Guillaume to take on Eastside

bitterly remarks: \"I don't have to do nothing but stay black and die

\" - then you know we're in trouble
