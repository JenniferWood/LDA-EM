This story is so well done

you don't even think of the fact that the characters are puppets

Emmet and his mother both (unknown to each other) take a risk to win a talent contest (and a large amount of money) to buy a nice Christmas present for each other

The tragic irony and suspense are well placed

After all

they can't both win

The dejection scene after the talent contest is done well

But the happy conclusion fits together like a puzzle

It is almost as if help from heaven has occurred

Instead of Emmet and his friends or his mother winning the contest and one prize

they ALL win

It is even clear that things will be easier for them in the years to come

The music and scenes are well done

Sorrow marches along side by side with comedy

and the characters are quite convincing

There is no outgrowing this beautiful Christmas movie
