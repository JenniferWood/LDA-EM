This is a great classic movie with a good story

It didn't need all the cgi of today's movies

I like the original just fine and all of the bonus features

but don't think it needed 3 different version disks with minimal changes

They added a very minuscule scene of the spaceship interior

I could have done without it or they could have made it more interesting

I rarely agree that it is better to leave endings or spaceship interiors to the imaginations of the viewers

although I'm not saying every movie always needs either

I just don't sit around long after the movies elaborately imagining what I might see or what an outcome is or sit and draw up my own story

it's their story and ideas

They discuss the size of the set being the largest of it's time and how they made mbay scenes and how they chose the cast

That's all I recall at the moment
