1964's \"Godzilla vs

Mothra

\" (originally released in the U

S

as \"Godzilla vs

The Thing\" as a publicity gimmick to hide the identity of Godzilla's adversary) is the best of the many sequels to the original \"Godzilla

\" The film series reached a level of wonderful pop-culture entertainment here: imaginative effects

gripping and simple story-line

and fantastic monster mashing

It's actually a smart

well-put together movie

something that people who look down on Japanese monster movies as silly and stupid would never expect

And it is LOADS of fun

This film followed up quickly on the massive success of \"King Kong vs

Godzilla

\" The studio

Toho

wanted Godzilla to go up against another `name' monster

and selected one of their own: the gigantic moth/caterpillar Mothra

who had starred the hit 1961 film &quot;Mothra

&quot; The story has Godzilla returning to wreck havoc on Japan (this is the last time for many years that Godzilla would be the unquestioned `bad guy')

defying the military's numerous ingenious -- but ineffective -- attempts to stop him

The one hope for humanity lies in recruiting Mothra to take on the big lizard

But the people of Infant Island where Mothra lives are reluctant to help because two unscrupulous businessmen have captured Morthra's lost egg and turned it into a sideshow attraction

When they refuse to surrender the egg

it begins to look like Godzilla will get to have his way with Japan unopposed





The film is absolutely loaded with stunning effects and action sequences

Godzilla's initial rampage in Nagoya is a knock-out

with the Big-G smashing a radio tower and Nagoya castle to the ground (Haruo Nakajima

the actor inside the suit

does a wonderful performance in this scene)

The Godzilla suit used in this movie

known as the \"Mosu-Goji\" to fans

is beautiful: sleek

evil

and extremely personable

The two confrontations between Godzilla and Mothra

the first time in moth form

the second time in caterpillar form

are the best monster fights in all of the G-movies

Effects wizard Eiji Tsubaraya finds creative ways to have the monsters tackle each other

and the music from Akira Ifukube just keeps building and building

The finale is as exciting as anything you'll see in a big effects film from any country

The human scenes are very effective as well

with good performances all around from actors like Kenji Sahara and Akira Takarada

regulars in monster movies

Director Ishiro Honda provides his customary humanitarian touch to the story

and he takes it with an appropriate level of seriousness

No doubt about it

Honda was a great director

and in his hands

giant monster movies could seem like more than just light entertainment

The version on this disc is the dubbed American version

The Japanese language version with subtitles is superior -- a five-star rating easily -- but has never been available on a home video format (someone should really do something about this

)

However

this is probably the best dubbed version ever of a Godzilla film

The voice acting is quite good

and almost nothing has been changed or edited from the original

Actually

a scene has been added

involving a U

S

military ploy to attack Godzilla with newly developed missiles

(Guess how effective that is

) The only real trouble with the dubbing is that the characters sometimes refer to Mothra as \"the Thing\" and other times by its real name

which is pretty strange sounding

The disc has nothing in the way of real extras

Also

the advertised 5

1 stereo is a cheat: the producers of the disc added a few extra sound effects here and there for the back speakers -- such as when Godzilla is being electrified or when tanks are firing -- that sound tinny

awful

and unconnected to the actual film

Stick with the original mono option

Even dubbed

\"Godzilla vs

Mothra\" is a four-star film and a must for anyone who loves giant monsters or just wants to have a good time on a Saturday night with friends

ROAR ON GODZILLA
