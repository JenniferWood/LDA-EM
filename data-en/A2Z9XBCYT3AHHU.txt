For anyone who loves X-files or anything dealing with the arrival of aliens on this planet

this is the film for you

The special effects are awesome and the story is brilliantly written and acted

and while there are government conspiracies

they are not as evil as in X-files

Close Encounters is a beautiful film that asks us to think about many questions dealing with life beyond earth
