For anyone who has seen this movie and loves it

the deleted scenes will help explain some of the events that left you wondering how you got to certain things

I will just tell you of one deleted scene so as not to ruin your viewing them

Carla is riding on the train and they are in the dining car

Need I say more

LOL Lovitz is at his best

Should have left it in the movie

Enjoy
