I bought this film after seeing most of it on A&amp;E

This film is by far the best way to see Joseph

The settings are beautiful and the entire look of the production are perfect in presenting the story

The casting choices could not have been better

Paul Mercurio is a perfect Joseph

Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts

This film is the best Joseph movie to date
