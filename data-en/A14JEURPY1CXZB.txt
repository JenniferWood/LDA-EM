Disney studios ended its family-friendly filmmaking in 1979 with two films: \"Unidentified Flying Oddball\" and \"North Avenue Irregulars

\" While \"U

F

O\" is a silly time-waster

\"North Avenue Irregulars\" remains a personal favorite

with an outstanding cast enlivening thin (and let's face it

dated) material and delivering loud and frequent laughs

Feminists will object strongly to the female stereotypes

but most everyone else will ignore the silliness of it all and find much to enjoy in this fast-paced lark

The Rev

Mike Hill (Edward Herrmann) has just taken over as pastor at North Avenue Presbyterian Church

much to the displeasure of Anne Woods (Susan Clark)

whose father recently retired as pastor

The rest of the flock includes daffy housewife Vicki (Barbara Harris)

dippy (and apparently wealthy) old maid Claire (Cloris Leachman)

ditsy engaged debutante Jane (Karen Valentine) whose fiance Howard is an insufferable mama's boy

dotty elderly couple Rose and Delaney Rafferty (Patsy Kelly and Douglas V

Fowley) and apparently the only level-headed member of the congregation

matronly African-American Cleo (Virginia Capers)

In his first decision as pastor

Mike decides to get the confrontation involved in church business by delegating responsibility

so he puts Rose in charge of the \"church sinking fund

\" Unfortunately

his plans backfire when Delaney loses the money in a horse race

so Mike angrily confronts the bookie

Harry the Hat (Alan Hale Jr



the skipper from \"Gilligan's Island\")

and demands he give the money back

but instead he's humiliated and thrown out on the street

A trip to the police proves fruitless

so he decides to take matters into his own hands by using his televised Sunday morning sermon to blast the city's out-of-control organized crime and corrupt officials

His tirade catches the eye of Treasury agent Marv Fogelberg (Michael Constantine) who enlists Mike to set up a sting operation in order to catch syndicate boss Max Roca (Joseph Campenella)

When he can't convince any of the city's men to help

he enlists the help of his churchladies

whose pluck he admires

At first Marv resists

then warms to the idea

after all

he says

\"Who would suspect a bunch of ding-a-ling dames

\"What follows is a series of laugh-out-loud confrontations between the bumbling churchladies (including Delaney in drag) and the frazzled crooks

and at least one jarring act of violence that snaps Anne out of her daze and angers her enough to join the gang

And with the exception of that one act

everything is played for silly laughs and the crooks are so hapless even when Vicki brings her kids along on a stakeout and car chase noone ever seems to be in real danger

What makes everything work so well is the cast

who all seem to be having a great time

There isn't a weak link among the performers

but there are standouts

especially Herrmann

who plays a refreshing change-of-pace

a religious authority figure who isn't crazy

judgmental or a member of the moral right

so much as a nice and decent guy and concerned citizen doing what he thinks is right; Clark

who simply is incapable of giving a bad performance

and Harris

who seems to be having a blast playing an atypical (for her) brain-dead loon

Capers (who sadly passed away a couple of months ago) also makes a strong impression and has one hilarious scene where she chases a crook while pushing a baby carriage

(An additional note on the casting: look closely at the young girl playing Mike's daughter Carmel; she's Melora Hardin

who grew up to play the beautiful and sexy woman murdered by President Gene Hackman's secret service detail in Clint Eastwood's \"Absolute Power

\")Other highlights include another of veteran Disney composer Robert F

Brunner's bouncy musical scores that really propels the action and will stick in your head for hours (if not days)

an above-average animated opening credits sequence

and a very funny last-minute appearance by Ruth Buzzi as a CB-addicted church official

Unfortunately

once again a '70's Disney film ends with that tired plot contrivance: a car chase/demolition derby that kids will enjoy but adults will find as old and tired as it was when the Keystone Kops did it in the silent movie days

But up until this point

the film scores a comedic bullseye

One note about Disney's DVD presentation: like most of Disney's films of the era

it was filmed in 1:66:1 widescreen format

However

Disney has cropped the top and bottom of the picture so that it fits on 1:85:1 widescreen TV screens

which seems to be a wide-spread practice with DVD transfers nowadays

(I've discovered this in Universal and MGM/UA releases as well

) They get by with this by labeling the DVD as presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen \"enhanced for widescreen TVs

\" So purists beware: you're getting widescreen format but losing the top and bottom of the picture

I find this annoying but less annoying than fullscreen

since you don't get the headache-enducing pan-and-scan effect and there is less important picture information lost on the top and bottom of the screen

Either way

nobody seems to have caught on to this

so I thought I'd pass it on

At least Disney has cleaned up the picture and \"North Avenue Irregulars\" looks better on this DVD than the grubby VHS version

**** (out of *****) for the film

**1/2 for the DVD

which features no extras whatsoever
