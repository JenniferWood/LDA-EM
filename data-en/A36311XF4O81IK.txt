This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level

I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt

On this level

the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like

The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality

unlike the many \"Hollywoodized\" Egyptian ventures

But

that's not the reward I got by the end of the film

It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films

And

the performances

especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role

(WHY don't we see more work from him

)

Martin Landau as his father Jacob

Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur

and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife

are exceptional

There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph

Most everyone already knows the story

Joseph is the favored son of his father

inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons

Joseph's brothers

They conspire to get rid of Joseph

but can't bring themselves to actually kill him

so they sell him into slavery

He ends up in Egpyt and

over the years

thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams

rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh

Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers

although they don't know who he is

The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one

Originally shown as a 2-part TV mini-series by TNT a few years ago

I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release - uninterrupted by commercials

and including a making-of featurette

Don't let this jewel get by you
