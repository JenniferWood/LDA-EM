I saw this movie on VHS a few years after it was in the theaters and have watched it multiple times over the years

I think it represents how the impossible can become the possible with visionary leadership

standards

and determination

While the methods employed by Joe Clark may not be considered politically correct in our common era

many schools would be greatly benefited by employing them
