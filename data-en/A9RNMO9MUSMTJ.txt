They dont make movies like this anymore

movies that entertain

makes youlaugh

great characters

and like any good movies

it becomes a multipleviewing feature

I view this film at least once a year

and its alwaysenjoyable

Nicholas Cage portrays a 50's type teenager and has this squeeky voice

and Kathleen Turner does a great job as the actress that is sent to the past to review events related to her life

I wont tell you any details

but i do recomment this movie a lot
