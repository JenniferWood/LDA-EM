this is the JOHN BOORMAN i love

the director of \"DELIVERANCE\" and \"THE EMERALD FOREST\" in addition to this excellent and haunting film

in his twin outstanding lead actors

a very thoughtful screenplay and breathtaking photography and direction

it all comes together for me

i withhold the fifth star as i am conflicted about the ending

that was john's artistic choice though

i don't do alternate endings
