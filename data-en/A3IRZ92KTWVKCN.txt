Doug Chesnick

played by Nicolas Cage

is the secret service agent assigned to protect President Carlisle's widow Tess

played by Shirley MacLaine

He chafes at the unimportance of his assignment but he especially would like to get away from her

She's difficult

rude

arbitrary

and won't let them do their jobs effectively

But when his current assignment is over and he gladly returns to Washington

he is told he has to go back

Tess called the president and wants him to stay

It is an almost constant battle of wills between them

with Tess usually winning

A key scene is of her wheeler-dealer businessman son (Edward Albert)coming to ask her to endorse a high-end golf club/housing development

He simply came there to use her

It is there in her face that she knows this

as she turns him down

Later

she is viewing video of television coverage of her husband's funeral

during which her son appears to be feeling nothing

while Doug's composure breaks

Brief

and covered quickly

but there's no doubt how he felt

Nicolas Cage is certainly a very good actor

We understand that Tess wants Doug close to her because he loved her husband and is the son she wished she had

Also

no one knows that she has an inoperable brain tumor and does not have long to live

Suffice it to say that her affection for him is justified when she is kidnapped

To Doug's great professional humiliation

top agents descend from Washington and take control; but Doug

unlike anyone else in the agency

realizes almost at once who is responsible and stops at nothing to extract the information he needs to save Tess's life

In the hands of two less-edgy actors it would probably be completely forgettable; but it works

Highly recommended
