That is well worth the taking

Tom Hanks headlines a stellar cast of mostly women

telling a true story about the sport of Baseball that not everybody knows even to this day

Madonna's song &#34;This Used To Be My Playground&#34; is a bittersweet and heartbreaking reminder that all of life

the good times and the bad

is fleeting

This one looks beautiful on Blu-ray

definitely worth a buy
