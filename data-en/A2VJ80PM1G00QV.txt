I found that I had forgotten all but a very few scenes since last I saw the movie years back

It is well worth another look for others in the same boat and

certainly for those who have never seen it

It is not

of course

a perfect film

earlier scenes are somewhat too broad in portrayal of the impact on the Star of what he has experienced

On the other hand

the culminating scenes are quite good given the limits of human imagination as to what such an 'close encounter' might actually entail

Richard Dreyfuss gets solo billing in the brief introductory credits at the beginning of the movie: quite an actor's coup but recognition of the weight put on his performance in sustaining most of the film

Two important female roles are well played and as a number of other key ones

All in all

still watchable after all these years
