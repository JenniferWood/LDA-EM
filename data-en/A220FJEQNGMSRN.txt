The best-loved of the Godzilla sequels and the film that set most Westerner's perceptions of the Kaiju genre

Mothra Vs

Godzilla doesn't hold up as well as memory has it

Yes

it has the iconic image of the giant egg on the beach and it has a couple of tiny singing fairy girls

but it's not exactly a lavish production nor a particularly exciting one

It's a long wait for Godzilla's first appearance (32 minutes) and a longer one for some monster-on-monster action (a full hour

although the US version does include a brief but spectacular scene cut from the Japanese version of the US Navy shelling Godzilla)

and when it comes it has to be said that Mothra and it's two caterpillar offspring aren't exactly the most exciting of critters

with a very limited bag of tricks between them

Still

the sequence where Godzilla's head (quite accidentally) catches fire is quite striking

It's also of note for being the last Godzilla film for twenty years to present the big feller as his original evil destructive self

with subsequent films presenting him as the protector of Japan

After their sterling efforts on the first film in the series

Classic Media's DVD is something of a disappointment: the original subtitled Japanese version is in a 2

35:1 widescreen ratio but looks like a somewhat soft standards conversion with a somewhat dupey look to the color

while the dubbed American version retitled Godzilla Vs

The Thing is presented in a cropped 1

85:1 with not much better picture quality

The audio commentary on the American version is good and there's a nice brief featurette about series composer Akira Ifukube

though otherwise only the unsubtitled Japanese trailer is included alongside a poster gallery
