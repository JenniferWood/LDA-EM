Apparently

Spielberg said he made War of the Worlds because it would be `fun' to do nasty aliens for a change

But just how `cuddly and benevolent' were these particular ET's

They terrorise a mother to within an inch of her life

pulling her child out of her own arms leaving her distraught and not knowing whether he is alive or dead

Why did they do that when they had dozens of adult abductees that had perfectly useful mature brains for study

Nasty aliens

And what about those adult abductees

Second World War guys

torn from wives or girlfriends

True love gone forever

Their parents probably dead in the interim

On top of that trauma they now have to adjust to a new world where they don't fit in

The result: depression and alcoholism

maybe even suicide

Nasty

nasty aliens

Then to cap it all off they come out of their mother ship naked and expose themselves to the reception committee

Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic

resulting in long term psychological problems

Except the French guy who no doubt treats that sort of thing with a Gallic shrug

Nasty

nasty

nasty aliens

Spielberg is fooling nobody but himself

See War of the Worlds

by the way

it's great

There's no plot

though
