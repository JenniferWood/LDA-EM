&quot;Excess Baggage&quot; is the type of movie that failed at the box office due to poor marketing

With the combination of Alicia Silverstone in a lead role and a trailer suggesting that this was mostly a comedy

I think a lot of people went into this flick with a wrong impression

I know I did

The first time I saw it I was rather disappointed

There was nothing inherently wrong with any performance or any facet of the movie itself

I think it was more that it wasn't what I expected

Luckily

I decided to let some time pass and view it again

I'm very glad I did because this is actually a solid movie

The role of the bratty rich kid was

of course

perfect for Alicia and she didn't have to stretch much to properly play the part

Benicio Del Toro was simply amazing

His mannerisms for his character are something you simply can't be taught

Del Toro is the real deal and you can't help but fall for his charm





even if he is playing a car thief

It goes without saying that Christopher Walken is flawless as usual

The guy's been around forever because he is one of the best acting talents in Hollywood

The story certainly has some amusing moments and situations

However

this is a story that's actually about love

loyalty and knowing your place in the world

By all appearances

Alicia Silverstone and Benicio Del Toro would make quite the unconvincing couple

As the movie progresses

however

you are truly moved by the bond that they form

&quot;Excess Baggage&quot; is a very special film that deserves an open mind and a keen eye for amazing acting and appreciation of a multi-layered storyline filled with deep moments
