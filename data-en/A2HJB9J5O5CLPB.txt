Had no idea that Francis Ford Copploa directed this

Saw it before but really didn't pay attention

A particular fantasy of mine

of lots of people

to go back to our youth

especially high school

and do it better or something

I'm sure this film prompted the Back to the Future Films and others

The old cars

the clothes

kind of an expensive

goofy Hollywood remake of adolescent memories

The lesson: It isn't what we did in the past

It's what we do in the present
