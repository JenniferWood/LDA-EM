This is a silly film

but I liked it anyway

Emily (Silverstone) never gets any attention from her rich dad

Mom died when Emily was very young

so she has been richly neglected for years

Emily stages a kidnapping

only to be inadvertently kidnapped by a car thief played by Benicio del Toro

I admit

I rented the film to see him

I wasn't disappointed in seeing del Toro in this film

The story is not that great

but after I saw it the second time (to see del Toro

okay

) it kind of grew on me

Christopher Walken plays Silverstone's uncle to perfection
