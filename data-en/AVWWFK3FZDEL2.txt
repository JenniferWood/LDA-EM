Henry Winkler stars in this remake of the classic tale of Scrooge

This one is set in post-Depression era America and is oneof the best I've ever seen

Winkler is equally at ease as a young man with a girlfriend or an old man with an attitude

I watch this every Christmas and was delighted to discover it on DVD

You'll love it
