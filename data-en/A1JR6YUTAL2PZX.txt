One of the top films of 1997

this film has neither graphic sex nor graphic violence

but it is one of the most disturbing films ever made

Neil Labute's directorial debut is literally breathtaking - at the end of the film you feel as though you'd been kicked in the solar plexus (his misogynist focus in this film broadens to general misanthropy in his second and

unfortunately

inferior film

Your Friends And Neighbors)

While the three leads are all outstanding

Aaron Eckhart's performance is absolutely chilling in its perfection - rumor has it that soon after the release of the film people would spit at him as they passed him in the street

Even if this is not true

it's easy to see why it could happen - he is so convincingly outwardly charming but

in truth

despicable

that you really have to remind yourself this is only a fictional character
