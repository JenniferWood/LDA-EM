This film (probably errantly) reminded me of the film Field of Dreams

in which

instead of extraterrestrial visitation

a middle aged guy starts seeing ghosts

So many of these movies are said to be meant as a metaphor (I suppose if one has a cause one wants to champion)

What about Close Encounters of the Third Kind

What is the hidden meaning or relevancy

if there is one

My cause

I suppose

is men's rights

I'm sympathetic towards the men's movement

When I watched

really listened (playing in the next room) the film Rain Man

I couldn't help wonder if the film makers were intentionally contrasting the two main characters in the film

Tom Cruise

a harried self-employed man

and Dustin Hoffman his brother who is stricken by Autism

Dozens of years ago (now long forgotten from memory) psychologists felt Autism was caused by some kind of environmental problem or parental neglect

But the existence of such an idea could potentially be offensive toward women and mothers somehow

In the film Rain Man itself

the film may be suggesting the child with Autism is the luckier or happier of the two

Watching Spielberg's film Jaws (which I may soon review)

the police chief makes it

the college guy makes it

but the working class guy just can't escape the shark

There's a scene

when their ship first sets out on the water

I believe

where you can see a reflection of the American flag showing on the water

When watching the paranoid SF film 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'

and it's sequel

the films are warning us

ironically

of mind control emanating from Hollywood

Planet of the Apes is warning us not just of mental degradation

a society where the humans don't speak

but also a kind of racial replacement

Enough is enough already with these old films

Thinking about Closer Encounters (after only first watching the whole movie on TV 5 or so years ago)

I had to wonder

myself

if this film was focusing on Richard Dreyfuss's mental illness

I remembered the scene of him throwing shrubs out the window

Are masses of American men in such dire straights

What about real people

apparently

who honestly believe they have been visited by UFO's

Is this film exploring mental illness

or is it meant to bring to life the thoughts of someone who genuinely believes they've been visited by aliens

Could there be a more noble cause than giving voice to such a voiceless and likely powerless person

The film Close Encounters of the Third Kind for the most part takes it's subject literally and doesn't seem to be a metaphor for something else

It's a good film that makes you think about the possibility of extraterrestrial life

There's a great line in the movie where Richard Dreyfuss

while speaking to a government official

tells the official

\"You can't fool us

by agreeing with us\"

Close Encounters shows government officials dealing with the public in a secretive and less than open and upfront way

Shouldn't government just be more open and honest

and about the people

Of the people

and not the elites

When watching Close Encounters again

I knew what to expect

There were the 'astronauts'

young people from all over the globe

dressed in their suits and apparently

waiting to board the alien ships

And the small aliens leave their ship

seemingly to be exchanged with them and ready to spend some time on Earth

I'd read stories of explorers and natives making exchanges like this

for the purpose of language acquisition

this scene reminded me of these stories

When the alien ship leaves

however

at the end of the film

no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the ship

Is it just me

or at the end

does the film show Richard Dreyfuss and no one else

getting on the alien ship before it leaves

The aliens sure went to a lot of trouble to pick up one guy from Indiana

I watched the ending again (although I haven't see all three versions)

and it's true

no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the alien ship
