After first seeing Reckless on Masterpiece Theatre

I was delighted to be able to purchase the series

If you are a fan of Robson Green

this is another fine example of his work; cast opposite Francesca Annis

the chemistry is palpable

Michael Kitchen is a superb actor as well

and makes for a great love triangle

Highly recommended for hours of enjoyment
