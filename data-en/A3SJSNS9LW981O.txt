An obsessed

ordinary man





his skeptical wife

his new neighbor friend

and the mega forces of a government and scientific community who seek to shield him from knowing the truth

Add to the mix a stirring soundtrack

top notch effects

a little humor here and there

a horrific abduction scene

and a consistent atmosphere of intrigue and mystery





The ending does seem a bit overdone and sentimental

but this movie is simply one of the best ever made

It set the standard for future filmmaking
