There's a reason that &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;

a low budget independent film

the first from writer-director Neil Labute

won an award at the Sundance Film Festival

The reason is not that it is an enjoyable film

but rather that LaBute demonstrates what so few filmmakers are willing to achieve: that film can be art

and not everybody is supposed to understand or like what you are saying

LaBute captures the self-absorption and resulting cruelty that EVERY alpha male raised in a fraternal corporate environment ever subscribed to - all roled into the unforgettable character of Chad

Using his persuasive skills to get his boss

Howard (Matt Malloy) to go along in this exercise of cruelty

Chad plays the game to the max

Along the way the audience gets the feel for the impersonable

alien corporate environment and good old boy atmosphere so recognizable in the U

S

Chad is portrayed instinctively by young actor Aaron Eckhart

who has traveled with LaBute through this and all subsequent films

sometimes in minor character roles

Eckhart and LaBute obviously have their pacing and teamwork together - Eckhart portrays Chad effortlessly

LaBute should be congratulated for not allowing &quot;the happy ending&quot;

instead twisting his conclusion to find yet another villainous side of Chad

The DVD is dark

with few special features

and since almost all of the film takes place indoors (an early LaBute signature)

the darkness of the tale is heightened by the appearance of the film

Striking out as a writer/director with a &quot;different voice&quot; (ala John Sayles) LaBute made his mark with &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; - and it is a fascinating study for serious film watchers
