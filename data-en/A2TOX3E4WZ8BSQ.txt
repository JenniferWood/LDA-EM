Now this is the way it should be

You get all three cuts

all remastered in 5

1 surround and all have been digitally transferred

Thank you so much Mr

Spielberg because this without a doubt has to be one of your best (along with the original ET)

Last night

I watched the original theatrical version and forgot how much was removed for the \"Special Editions\" and the final \"Director's Cut\"

In my mind

the original version is the best and to finally have it in all it's uncut 5

1 surround sound (which didn't exist back then) glory is simply wonderful

The packaging is nice

although I found it very difficult to remove the DVDs without fearing I might snap them because the locking mechanism seems to not want to let go of the DVDs no matter how hard I press down on them

I suppose I could look at it in that I shouldn't fear them coming off during shipping and getting scratched up

The box is nicely designed and inside are some wonderful items

It comes with a poster that gives a time line for each movie and where each cut differs which I found really interesting

It also comes with a book full of bios on the actors and other people that worked on the film

Plenty of in-movie and behind-the-scene shots

Finally

the three DVDs are housed in a tri-fold container

Inside and outside are colorful shots from the movies and it really makes the entire set look nice

In addition to the three editions of the movies

there is also a new \"30 Years\" documentary looking back over time at how CE has been a favorite movie that has stood the test of time

Also

the making-of documentary that was on the original Director's Edition that came out a few years ago has been split across the three DVDs

Also included is the 1977 making of documentary which was also on the previously released Director's Cut DVD

Missing are all the \"deleted\" scenes that were included on the Director's Cut

So

if you own that one

it might be best to keep it since they are absent from this edition

Overall

this is an excellent release and no one should be without it

To finally watch it like I did when it first came out back in 1977 (and I lived in Muncie

Indiana at that time so you can just imagine what the crowd did when that came up during the movie) was so refreshing and wonderful that I can't wait to watch it again
