I t seems like only yesterday when I was in 2nd grade

and the movie &quot;A League of their Own&quot; was a hit in theaters

Why was it a hit

you might ask

I myself think that it's because &quot;A League of their own&quot; attracks a wide audience range

I saw this when I was little

but adults enjoy it as well

It can be told as a sports story

but also includes love stories

It also is good for World War II buff's because (most of) it takes place in the WWII era

The story begins with Dotty Hensen (Geena Davis) who is then an older grandmother

She is invited to a new Hall of Fame dedicated to the Women's Baseball League

When coming into the field to meet her old teammates

she starts to remember everything that happened

That's when the movie flashes back in time and the main story takes place

Dotty is invited to play for a new league of Women's Baseball

since the men are at war

She accepts

only if her kid sister Kit (Lori Petty) can come along

Finally they both try out and get into the same team

Rockaford Peaches

Jimmy Doogan (Tom Hanks) is the team's coach

and doesn't exactly like the concept of coaching girls baseball

From then on

friendships grow among the players and historical instinces occur

Overall

I'd reccomend &quot;A League of Their own&quot; to fans of movies in general

The acting is great

Madonna (Mae) and Rosie O'Donnell (Doris) also make this movie funny

This is one of the best movies of the 90's

and no one's collection is complete without it
