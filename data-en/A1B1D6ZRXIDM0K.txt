I can't believe this comes with three versions of the film - wow

what a bargain

I love this movie and most of Spielberg's others

so I'm very proud to have the poster this came with (the movie poster side facing forward - not the version comparison) on my door

I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly this arrived

Thanks
