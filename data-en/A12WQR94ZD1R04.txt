A good crisp copy

worth the upgrade

The story deals with forgiveness and compassion

shown to one man

and the relentless pursuit of anothr man wanting justice

to forfill hs own desires

If you want a good story on how to be humble and walk in humility buy this movie

I have copies of all the Les Misirables films made

They are all well acted and all vary from one to the other slightly

I shall be purchasing the musical version when it comes down in price
