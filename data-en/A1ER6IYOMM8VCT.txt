I have said this in my past reviews of the Godzilla series

I grew up on these films and I have fond memories of watching them

but they are very juvenile

Even the Japanese versions are juvenile









Having said that

I wish that these films were cleaned up

The print here isn't bad

but looks like there is room for much improvement

The features are quite good and considering the age of the material it is nice to see some of this stuff

I think 3 stars for any of these Godzilla movies is fair









5 stars

Come on this isn't \"Gone with the Wind\" Please(Big G fans)don't have a hissy fit

I'm not really bashing \"old radiation breath\" he is a part of my childhood

If the prints were cleaned up and the extras were longer I'd give the release 5 stars

As it is

it's a fun entry in a juvenile series
