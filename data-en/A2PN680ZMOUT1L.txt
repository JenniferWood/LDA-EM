I agree with one of the reviews that Coppola is the best director of the past thiry - forty years

I saw Peggy Sue when it first opened

I didn't appreciate it then

The musical score and the cinematography should let you know it's basically not a comedy but a meditation

It is deep and poignant and I could watch it many times

It may be one of the undervalued films of all time
