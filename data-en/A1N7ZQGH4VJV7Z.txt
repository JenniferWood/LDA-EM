This movie is why DVD players were invented

I remember seeing this in the theater 24 years ago and not quite understanding what it meant (I was only 7)

The 1980 re-release added a couple of scenes including the ticket-selling final sequence inside the mother ship

The DVD version of Close Encounters contains neither the original version nor the Special Edition

Instead

DVD owners are treated to the &quot;Directors Cut&quot; that &quot;





can be seen and enjoyed as he has always intended





&quot;

This basically means that the sequence inside the mother ship is cut out (a sequence he never wanted to do anyway) and a few scenes that were included in the original were put back (including a favorite scene of mine of Roy taking plants and fencing from the neighbors to build his mountain)

I personally love this director's cut

I must admit my initial viewing ended in disappointment when the final mother ship sequence had been removed

After watching the phenomenal documentary on disc 2

I understand why it was taken away (you can still view the scene as part of the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; portion of disc 2)

The documentary really gives the view a renewed appreciation of what it took to make this film

We've waited a long time for this DVD and it doesn't disappoint

It deserves 5 stars (though it would have been even better had it included the parody

&quot;Closet Cases of the Nerd Kind&quot;)
