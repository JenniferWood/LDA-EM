Between autumn 1975

after Jaws had become such a

excuse the pun

monster hit the previous summer

and November 1977

when Close Encounters finally opened

it held the distinction of being the most eagerly awaited movie since Gone with the Wind

Alas

it didn't turn out to be the attraction for the ages that so many people

myself included

had hoped

That said

it does deliver a terrific amount of entertainment value

The title refers to a phrase invented by science author J

Allan Hynek (who shows up in a cameo role) to describe three potential interactions between humans and alien life forms

The first involves a sighting

the second produces physical evidence

and the third results in some sort of contact

In this story

Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss)

an Indiana electric utility company worker and family man

experiences a close encounter of the first kind one night while investigating a power outage

He sees something extraordinary that scares the wits out of him and also leaves him with an encounter of the second kind (a partial sunburn) and disturbs him so severely that it eventually estranges his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) and his children

But the episode also endears him to Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon)

a similarly tormented

single mother whose son (played amazingly well by four-year-old Cary Guffey) has been kidnapped

presumably by the aliens

While Neary tries desperately to figure out what is going on

in another part of the country a secret team led by French scientist Claude Lacombe (the great movie director Francois Truffaut) is investigating the recent strange occurrences

and the efforts eventually draw everyone involved to a climactic meeting at a most distinctive geographic landmark

Spielberg orchestrated that climax with so much visceral power that I once saw a fellow moviegoer weeping uncontrollably after the house lights came back up

The movie's emotional punch even caused Stanley Kaufman

the august movie critic of The New Republic

to call Close Encounters not so much a movie as \"an event in the history of faith

\" In more proper perspective

Gary Arnold concluded his review in The Washington Post by saying that if real aliens ever landed and they didn't resemble Spielberg's vision

\"they obviously aren't movie lovers

have no romance in their souls

and to hell with `em

\" However you end up reacting

you'll probably agree that Close Encounters demonstrated how Spielberg was destined to become a giant of American cinema

In an interview with Film Comment magazine

Spielberg once summed up his abilities by saying

\"I sort of know what works

\" It's true

What's also true is Close Encounters works despite making very little sense - if start asking obvious questions the whole story begins to fall apart

No matter

Spielberg communicates subliminally to moviegoers so effectively that they willingly buy on

whatever the logical shortcomings

Along with the director's considerable skills at cinematic storytelling

the movie boasts dazzling and groundbreaking visual effects by Douglas Trumbull; gorgeous

Oscar-winning cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond

and possibly the best work that composer John Williams has ever done

It's an absolute crowd-pleaser
