A crowd of people that don't get along are on the lam and take a couple hostages

The cops are mad

the mob is mad

cars are stolen

and I was bored

Nothing substantially interesting is brought to the table

and the tepid classic rock tunes selected as the soundtrack make the going even more tedious

Basically a bunch of not-so-brights don't think their caper through and it all goes awry

The interminable dialogue interludes are downright boring

yet fitting what with the stupidity of the characters

Ice-Cube's non-acting ability highlights the moronic nature of the whole thing

Martin Sheen was absolutely hilarious as the mobster creepy guy

I laughed outloud many a time as he blathered about

I don't know if he was trying to satirize Brando's metaphysical mutterings from 'Apocalypse Now

' but it sure came across that way
