One of the best-done Bible movies ever

if not the very best

I'm a pastor

Great acting; great story telling

Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness

The theology in this has nothing objectionable

and I'm a stickler on getting theology right

since that's my job

Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off

Great theological themes pervade the movie

Like someone else said

I could've done without the bath scene

There's no nudity in it

and something like this might have happened

sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters

I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up

Don't let that deter you from buying this

though

This is in the series done by Ted Turner

I wish Christians

in making Biblical movies

would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film

Bravo

I love this movie
