Seldom does anything from Disney disappoint

and &quot;The North Avenue Irregulars&quot; doesn't

A sheer comic delight based on the premise of a group of church-going women setting off to undo small-town mob infiltration

the film packs some true rib-ticklers

In his role of the church's miniser

Edward Herrmann shows a rare comic side that

when first shown

was an about-face from his splendid dramatic work in the &quot;Franklin and Eleanor&quot; duo

But Herrmann is clearly upstaged by his supporting cast of distaffers

which is what this film calls for

and Cloris Leachman and the late Patsy Kelly are riotous

She has one of the film's best scenes with two confederates who try vainly to catch a suspected mob figure

running a refreshment stand

in a taped confession

Turning the recorder on only to get the Andrews Sisters' version of &quot;Roll Out the Barrell&quot; is nothing but splendid comedy

In sum

the film is one of those hidden gems that doesn't give us any serious social message or calls attention to the state of the status quo and instead gives us a welcome relief from all that serious stuff
