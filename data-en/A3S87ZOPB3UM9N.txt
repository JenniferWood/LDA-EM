The movie starts out with a young man challenging an older man and coming away looking rather beaten up

The next thing you know the police are arresting him for killing this man

At the time it looks all very possible

The story is then told by this defendant on what his relationship with this man is

You quickly find out he is his father

but not in any traditional (except for biological) sense

This story is of an odd estranged relationship between a father and his son and the woman between them both

The dynamic between all three is that of control

The mother

a taciturn woman was impregnated by her employer

a powerful representative of the court

the bailiff

Basically he's the guy who does the dirty work

seizing property

notifying tenants of evictions etc

He is a man who takes his level of control of the world for granted

Well

there is one thing he does not control and it is this woman

She takes this opportunity to wrest her small amount of control in the world from him and raises her son on her own

Of course this bailiff is persistent in his efforts to gain control

but there is very little he can do

The son

grows up aware of who his father is at a distance and soon enough becomes a pawn

in his control games

He comes by his own issues of control soon enough and as various situations develop

you see a parallel in their lives

I felt this movie was very well done

These are highly emotional people with very few words exchanged

Amazing how little can be said but mean so much
