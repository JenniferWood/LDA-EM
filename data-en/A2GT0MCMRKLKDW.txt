If you're looking for a relaxing sci-fi comedy

this should fill the bill very nicely

It's the story of a widower (Dan Ackroyd) and his teen-age daughter

and how Ackroyd's character somehow sends a high powered beam to another galaxy

This beam upsets thing on this other world

so they send an agent (Kim Basinger) to find out how it was done and undo it

She has an assistant who looks like a large worm with only one big eye

The story is fairly straightforward

including the scientist's rather girl-crazy brother

It all works out in the end

but just how it does is loaded with guffaws and belly-laughs

I'm sorry I couldn't give it five stars

but it just wasn't quite there

Still

I do think you'll enjoy it

if you're into this type of \"No-brainer\" entertainment
