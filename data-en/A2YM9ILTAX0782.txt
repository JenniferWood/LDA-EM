SPOILERS: \"In the Company of Men\" (1997) is an unflinching depiction of masculinity at its worst

featuring one of the evilest male villains of all time--all the more amazing because he never shoots a gun

throws a punch

or even yells

Neil LaBute

the director and writer

called the movie \"a simple story

\" explaining

\"Boy meets girl

boys crush girl

boys giggle

\" Two businessmen

in their early thirties and both recently jilted

find themselves angry at womankind

They travel on a seven-week assignment to a new town and collude to avenge their wounded hearts

They decide to find a woman

somewhat of a wallflower

and woo her

When she becomes emotionally involved

they will then yank the rug out from under her and let her crash to earth

From then on

no matter how badly mistreated they are by women

they will know that they have this one \"success\" to look back on and laugh

They find a beautiful but deaf secretary in the new office

Both men begin to date her

Not used to so much attention

she is swept away

One of the men is fairly decent

Howard

and he begins to actually fall in love with her

The other

Chad

is heartless

and she falls for him

Howard

angry at her affection for Chad

tells her of their collusion

She confronts Chad and he confesses while laughing in her face

Explains on reviewer

\"LaBute's characters are so lost to themselves

so separated from their souls

that they can't feel anything; they hurt people in order to feel something

\"The film is intensely brutal for the male viewer precisely because 1) we know men likes this or 2) we are men like this

In fact

I would venture to say

although most men are not like Chad

we have at times expressed emotions just as base and mean as his

Truly the power of this film lies in Neil LaBute's powerfully realistic dialogue

The film does not hold back

and some of the dialogue

in which the two men laugh about the woman's \"retard speech

\" is as discomfiting as any scene of violence in \"A Clockwork Orange

\" LaBute proves that dialogue can be as powerful as any other aspect of the cinema

perhaps even more so

This is a film you must see--and afterwards pray for forgiveness for your mistreatment of women

LaBute

thankfully

leaves a small out in his film for men

Chad appears too have homosexual inclinations

In one instance

he uses his power in the office to get a man to show him his genitals (the only scene which I felt was unrealistic) and in another scene he glances down at a man using the urinal

The insinuation

I think

is that the film is not so much about the evils of men (such would be an unfair exaggeration) but about the evils of powerful men
