I saw this movie way back in the 80s and so enjoyed it then

Shirley MacLaine is priceless as a crotchety ex President's wife who really hates the world and everyone in it

(I do believe it's because of the death of her dear husband and the loneliness that always accompanies such a loss

She makes life miserable for her staff

and the Secret Service Agents assigned to guard her

They want to quit and she won't allow it

She seems to love making their lives a nightmare

A mix of bitter sweetness with a few laughs tucked in here and there
