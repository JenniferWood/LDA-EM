'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is more of a children's movie

Although adults will appreciate it

most of them will wonder what was the point behind it

On a crystal clear summer night

average citizens witness what appear to be UFOs in the sky

For some the UFOs affect them more than others

A child

his mother

Richard Dreyfuss

and a dozen other unnamed people begin seeing visions in their head

They see a geographical structure

but can't make sense of it

Later they find out it is Devil's Tower in the west

Cut between these stories are small stories of strange events happening across the world; stretching from Mexico to India

In the middle of the Gobi desert

a seaship is found

Finally our heros

Richard Dreyfuss and a woman reach the Devil's Tower for the climax

The climax is enjoyable if one of able to make sense of it

Some people will look at it and say

\"Wow look at all the pretty spaceships

\" Maybe Speilberg was trying to entertain and mystify us for two hours

which he does at certain momements

I guess what he's trying to say is

\"Aliens are not harmful

They are here to make peace with us

\" But at the end

when the gigantic spaceship rises behind Devil's Tower

the only thing I was thinking was

\"Wow the only thing bigger than that spaceship is Speilberg's ego

\"
