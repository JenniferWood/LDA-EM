The only difference between the plot of the film and reality is than in the movie the character named Chad warn us about how despicable he is going to be

People change to acomodate themselves for a woman or man they love (\"The Shape of Things\")

and people (successful people) sometimes hurt others for the perverse sheer of it

Power is to make people do things that they wouldn't do voluntarily

but do it anyway

To convince them that what they must do is even their idea is absolute power

and this is what the film is about (and many other things)

Chad is a bad man

but the system which acomodates him is no better: it is in fact the source of the possibility of evil

if not the direct producer

The deaf girl goes out at the same time with a hunk and with a boss

and doesn't have a problem with it

She later explain what made her to be bad

but forgets to add why between the two she choosed the bad guy (Chad probably hinted things to see her blindly comply)

Doing bad to others because you can or because somebody did something to you: relevant to our times

be it in Israel (wink wink) or in the USA

I only wish LaBute to prescribe something after his descriptions of social hell

Or at least explore the causes and different levels of consequences of horrible acts

But he doesn't

He presents us with the essence of the social evil and let us reflect ourselves on it

And that was in 1997

Now

in 2005

the situation is not better

If neo-conservative economics (an oxymoron

btw)

false feminism (in a \"Sex on the City\" style) and the fall of middle and middle-low class man are allowed to continue

we will have only ourselves to blame for the results

\"In the Company of Men\" is only a hint of what is hovering over us

Lets get cover

P

S

: There is only one thing that bothers me about the film: the tendency to give expected punchlines

as when Chad is telling his co-workers how he despises one sales rep or another

Is unnecesary and adds a layer of \"independent-film\" fashionable cynism that this film doesn't need

Out of that

a great work
