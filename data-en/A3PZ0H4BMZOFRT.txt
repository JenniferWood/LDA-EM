One of the last of the great Disney family comedies

with an all-star cast that would be hard to top even today

\"The North Avenue Irregulars\" is a fun

very funny film based on the true story of Reverend Albert Fay Hill - a small-town minister who took on the local gambling mob armed with nothing but a handful of church ladies

Edward Herrmann

absolutely perfect for the part

stars as Reverend Michael Hill (the first name changed for the film)

recently relocated to the North Avenue Presbyterian Church on the east coast

Seeking to get his congregation more involved with the day to day activities of the church

Reverend Hill's first act is to delegate the church's sinking fund to Rose Delaney (Patsy Kelly)

suggesting she come up with ideas of how to bring more money into the fund

But when Rose's husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) - a compulsive gambler - gets his hands on the money and puts it all on a horse instead

Reverend Hill takes it upon himself to hightail it over to the local bookie to get it back





but is just in time to see the entire fund lost when Delaney's horse doesn't come in

Hill reports the gambling operation to the local police - who

viewers soon learn

are on the take and in the pocket of the local mob bosses

And when Reverend Hill gets hot under the collar and blurts out the town's gambling/crime problem on local television

Hill gets the attention of both the Treasury Department





and the crime bosses determined not to lose their very profitable operation

When none of his male parishioners will help to try and break up the gambling ring

Hill (and the feds) are forced instead to rely on the only volunteers they have - five church ladies who want to clean up their town in between kids and beauty shop appointments and little league games

And as the five ladies are comprised of Patsy Kelly

Barbara Harris

Cloris Leachman

Karen Valentine

and Virginia Capers

things get pretty hilarious when the ladies' first efforts are botched completely

and the mob eventually figures out what they are trying to do

This is one of those films that can be a bit over the top at times

but at heart is a wonderful

feel-good comedy with some excellent moments

and wonderful performances

especially by Barbara Harris

Ruth Buzzi as a CB-wielding church elder

and in particular the one-and-only Cloris Leachman

who steals a few scenes with ease (including one

regarding the destruction of her fingernails

that is downright hilarious)

Michael Constantine

as the beleaguered federal agent with a nervous stomach

is also hilarious (and look for a very young Melora Hardin

star of \"The Office

\" as Reverend Hill's daughter

)

Thirty years after it was made

\"The North Avenue Irregulars\" is a heartwarming

delightful family film that not only holds up to the test of time





it's also a genuine treat to watch
