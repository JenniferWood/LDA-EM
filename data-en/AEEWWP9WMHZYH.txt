If you have read Victor Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables

you will find that this version is the best screen adaptation of the currently available four: the 1935 version with Frederic March & Charles Laughton; the 1952 one with Michael Rennie & Robert Newton; the 1978 one with Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins and the current one(1998) with Liam Neeson

Geoffrey Rush and Uma Thurman

The acting is superb and Uma Thurman gives a stellar portrayal of Fantine that is the most convincing of all four Fantines

If you don't have the time to read Victor Hugo's book

this movie is the best substitute
