This Sony blu-ray version (30th anniversary ed

) includes all 3 movie versions (theater

extended

and director's cut)

each with enough additional footage to make it worthwhile to view all 3 over several nights

just for comparison sake

Let's get this right out of the way: Close Encounters of the Third Kind is beautiful

This is a film that is very much of its time

with an abundance of film grain and exceptional contrast and color

This stellar Blu-ray edition is

quite simply

the most accurate and balanced version of this film ever seen outside of the editing bay in 1977

Make no mistake

this film is full of glorious

living grain

It swirls around the frame and comes to life in almost every scene of the film

This is how Close Encounters of the Third Kind is supposed to look

It would be a complete travesty if this film had been smoothed out and homogenized for the Blu-ray release

Fortunately

the magicians at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment have striven to get this one right and no less an authority than Steven Spielberg has given this startlingly gorgeous transfer his blessing

I was blown away by the film's deep and robust shadow detail

Black levels are consistently outstanding and are never crushed

Flesh-tones are incredibly warm and fine detail is never compromised

Richard Dreyfuss' &#34;sunburn&#34; effect is very noticeable in this version

unlike past VHS/DVD renderings where it was muted

This extreme level of detail is what allows the grain structure of Close Encounters of the Third Kind to be so perfectly rendered in this Blu-ray edition

I have never seen high definition video look as much like actual film as this Blu-ray does

Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a sterling example of how an older film can shine on Blu-ray

I encourage every interested party to investigate this title first-hand

Audio QualitySony has served up both DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD lossless tracks for this release

Over 5

1 surround sound speakers

I heard sounds not noticeable on other renderings

which made the viewing more enjoyable and like being in a movie theater

Good job

Sony
