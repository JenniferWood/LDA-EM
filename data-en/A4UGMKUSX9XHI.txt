If you are looking at these reviews you already know what a great story Spielberg put to film back in the 70s and like me may well have fond memories of watching this one in the theatre

You likely

therefore

are more interested in how it all comes across on blu-ray:I got this a couple months back and I have been very impressed

For the obsessive (or just curious) there are multiple versions of the movie and you can even select to have an on-screen indication of whether or not each scene you are watching was in other versions or not

I am a bit of a purist and tend to like the theatrical version but there are good and bad things (relatively) to say about each version

In this case

you don't have to compromise





you get them all

They even include a card summarizing the different versions and their differences so you can choose before you hit 'play'

I disagree with another reviewer who felt the transfer was bad

I feel the picture is very sharp

way sharper than any way I have seen this in the past

For example

in prior versions early in the movie when the alien ships turn their lights out

you could only \"see\" the ship moving among the stars by seeing some brighter stars wink out

now you can see all the stars and the \"shadow\" of the ship has substance

The discs sound great as well

Overall

I am very impressed and recommend this to anyone

especially at this price (I paid quite a bit more than the current price and still feel I got a good value)
