Morgan Freeman's role in \"Lean on Me\" is typical of the kind of roles he's particularly good at: \"My way or the highway

\" He nearly sinks his own efforts to turn around a failing school by acting as if he ALONE is the only one that can get the job done

This is a lesson for every administrator out there: \"Lean on\" Your Staff/Faculty

Give your staff and faculty the respect they are entitled to and they will work for you and the students much better than if you brow beat them and circumvent their authority as professional educators

It is only when Freeman's character learns this that things begin to go his well-intentioned way

NOTE: This outstanding film is now packaged with another outstanding film on education

Stand and Deliver/Lean on Me

These films are worthy of a place in your DVD collection
