This is truly a Bench-Mark for Aliens come to Earth Science Fiction

With the other entire extreme (aliens are here to eat us

aliens are here for our water

air

women







) available for viewing

this is a refreshing look at another point of view

Also

having the Original-Theatrical

the Special-Edition and the Directors-Cut just makes it better; whether you are into nostalgia

or getting to see it at fully blown-away proportions
