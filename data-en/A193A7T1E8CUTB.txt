Well

me for one

The main character of this movie

for another

But for some reason

not the main character's wife and kids

Some people see this movie as the escape of the main character from the drudgery of life on earth

But I think they have missed the film completely

Of the three versions of the film

I prefer the original

To explain why

let me begin simply by offering some snippets from the different edits

without explanation: In the original version

we are given a very meaningful cut going from a young child running after UFO's under the night sky

to the main character's music box playing

'when you wish upon a star' from the Disney version of Pinnochio (instead of going to the main character's own kid bugging him about doing his homework for him

as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a meaningful cut going from the main character trying to explain what he saw to his wife

to his wife hiding newspaper clippings from her husband dealing with the same topic (instead of going to an old Navy ship left in the desert of Mongolia

as in the later editions); in the original version we are given a seamless transition going from a team of scientists learning about a set of musical notes in India

to an attempt to translate them into hand signals

to an attempt to use them to contact the aliens by transmitting them by radio--to a young child successfully using the same notes on a toy xylophone

The theme of this movie is about seeing the ordinary as extraordinary

It might also be called: \"Man

Machine and the Northern lights

\" Or even

\"Pinnochio for Physics Majors

\" Though \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" suits it well enough

First kind: sighting

Second kind: physical evidence

Third kind: contact

These terms were coined by Hynek to categorize reports of UFO's

Spielberg applies them in a way more down to earth

The ordinary things seen as extraordinary: technology

seen as part of nature

like the northern lights; human beings and relationships

seen as remarkable and unusual as alien encounters--or as wooden puppets become real boys

The hero portrays an ordinary man who is childlike and single hearted

In terms of categorization

the movie might best be characterized as a visual-musical fantasy

though strictly speaking it is of course science fiction

It is quite ingeniously directed and very beautifully choreographed

Superficially

it is about alien contact

but at a deeper level

it is a beautiful depiction of the limits (and limited validity) of a mechanical approach to life

In the end

it's more about human contact

than about alien contact

The film consists of several sub-plots which gradually dovetail together

At the summit: The hero

Roy Neary

and a young boy

Barry Guiler

having kindred spirits

are

so to speak--through many trials and despite themselves--eventually brought together as family

one might even say providentially so

This family is contrasted to some vivid scenes of domestic life lived in narrow and petty way; the new family feels at home with itself while welcoming the most distant strangers: visitors from the stars

This openness is conveyed on the level of a child who is too innocent to even know the difference between an alien and a human; I would say

precisely

that it was Spielberg's main accomplishment in this film to convey it

Here Barry

a toddler

even steals the show--reportedly nicknamed by Spielberg as the \"one take\" kid

Though outwardly a movie about aliens

the visitors ultimately have

in this sense

the simple role of introducing the boy--and his widowed mom

Jillian--to the man (and very much from the point of view of the kid)

It is

as it were

the antithesis of the premise for \"Lost in Space

\" of a family huddled together in an alien and hostile universe

If the child in you is dead

don't waste your time watching this film

If the adult in you is alive

be willing to see the film multiple times

It hangs together very well

but it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it and see why

Perhaps it even takes the multiple re-cuts

This film made a big impact on me when I first saw the original version; watching the re-cuts and analyzing why it had such an impact for me did go hand in hand

It is very interesting to now see side-by-side the three different versions of this film which Spielberg came out with reworking it over the years; I'm happy to have the three provided together in this anniversary DVD

The line from the film which I made into the title of this review--spoken by one of Neary's sons--was actually not in the original cut

But it summarizes the original just as well as it does the other two versions (the \"special edition\" and the subsequent

\"director's cut\")

nonetheless

Spielberg followed his gut in this film

but he didn't check his brain at the door

Both have served him well

I see the original edition as the definitive one

and the two re-cuts as commentary and footnotes

Spielberg has referred to the director's cut as penultimate

I do not exclude the possibility of a new

ultimate version

Spielberg says that the original version suffered by being rushed due to studio pressures

and that the special edition was compromised by studio politics which required a \"peek inside the mothership

\" The director's cut

it seems to me (and others)

was compromised by being made-for-tv

The second two editions do provide insight (and unused footage) into Spielberg's original vision; but I think the original cut still remains the b
