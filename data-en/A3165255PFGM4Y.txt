A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is spectaculary beautiful and very funny

Of all the team players

Davis is the stand out

giving a touchingly modest performance that shows her range and diversity when it comes to choosing parts in cinema

Her split scene is still my favorite scene in a film ever

And I mean ever
