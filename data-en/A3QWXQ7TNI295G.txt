This does have the choice between pann and scann and Letterbox format

but the rest of the DVD is sucky

They could have presented the film subtitled in it's original Japanese version

with the Jpanese and American trailers and with Special effects outakes and the American sequince but they didn't do that

However

the Widescreen presentation is crystal clear and this looks 100 tiumes better than the rather dispappointing Japanese laserdisk (that had kind of muted colors and was OVERLY letterboxed (it was like in 2

76:1)

This is dubbed but it's not bad at all

The only problem with AIP's Titan Productions dubbing is that it's kind of garbled and hard to make out

though it's better than most of Toho's international version dubbing

The real problem though is the pathetic extras

the fake trailers which are just video advertisemnets and the pathetic picture gallery

However

this is one of Honda's greatest masterpeices and Japan's best sci-fi films

though it is bested by Matango

Magic Serpent and Goke

If only they could release those films on DVD

This bests all of Honda's other monster movies (exept for Matango)

even the original Godzilla and Mothra

All in all

if you can get past the sucky DVD extras

get this film
