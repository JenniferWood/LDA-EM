One of the most delightful made-for-television Christmas stories ever produced and released and I'm especially pleased that it's now available on DVD

For those of you not familiar with the story

Emmet Otter and his single mother are struggling to survive

with Emmet doing odd jobs and his Ma taking in laundry

Separately they each secretly decide to enter a Christmas Eve talent contest -- Ma with her beautiful voice and Emmet organizing a Jug-Band

Both must compete against the Riverbottom Gang's wild electric band made up of the Riverbottom Gang

A joyous Jim Henson musical production

narrated by Kermit-the-Frog

I especially recommend this for all ages

elementary school youngsters through senior citizens

After viewing this story of Emmet and his mother you'll be in the mood to celebrate Christmas
