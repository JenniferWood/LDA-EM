The main problem with Excess Baggage is how the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be

Is it a comedy

It fails in this regard because it's not funny

Is it serious

The storyline is about a girl being kidnapped (Alicia Silverstone's character) but it *can't* be serious if the movie writers try implementing comedy bits the entire time the kidnapping is taking place

Therefore





the entire movie feels kind of pointless to me

and furthermore

trying to combine two different styles (comedy and drama) makes it hard for viewers to figure out exactly which direction the writers were going for when creating this storyline

The whole movie has a very weak storyline

A woman is kidnapped

but not taking it seriously at *all* because of the comedy aspects

so she does things such as deliberately handcuff herself to the car

swallows a key

and the \"bad guy\" (a young punk who's about as theatening as a sweat bee) has no choice but to go through with the kidnapping

Yeah

eventually the bad guy decides to free Alicia's character

but she declines





I guess because she's developed a crush on the kidnapper

Such a bad idea for a storyline it's not even funny





literally

and fails twice as hard as a result

Excess Baggage also feels like wasted potential on the part of Christopher Walken

who's obvious a much better actor than he portrays in this movie

Everything about the movie seems to focus on how attractive Alicia Silverstone is and putting the spotlight on her above everyone else

and that's the problem with it

Yes

she's very attractive

but that doesn't mean the storyline suddenly becomes interesting

We need *something* to work with here

I say skip this one

Now I know why I never even heard of this movie back in the day
