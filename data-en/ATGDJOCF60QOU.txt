This is one of the only Godzilla movies of all time

and it was the best of the showa era

The music of the whole movie fits perfect



this is my favorite godzilla theme

Second The movie has the best suit of the showa era

The story is great a greedy business man steals a giant egg

and the two girls from the movie mothra have come to warn that it will hatch and destroy japan

But soon godzilla raises from the grave and starts wrecking havoc

I feel godzilla could have had a little more destruction but this movie is perfect
