I've been a Les Miserables fan for about as long as I've been a concsious being

I love the musical

the novel and several film versions

However adapting Hugo's epic novel (easily over a thousand pages) which spans several decades into a 2 hour film is a difficult task for anyone

The various made for TV miniseries have the luxury of time to present the story in something resembling it's entirty

Given the challenges I think the creative team did an admirable job

Yes

there are some huge cuts (gone is Enjolras whose function is filled by Marius

gone is Eponine

and the Threnardiers make only brief appearance) but the writers of the screenplay manage to streamline the story fairly well

keeping the focus on the fugitive Jean Valjean's redemption

Imprisoned for almost two decades for stealing a loaf of bread

Valjean leaves prison a hardened criminal who takes refuge one night in the home of the Bishop of Dinge

Valjean repays the Bishop's kindness by stealing his silver

When he is caught and brought before the Bishop

the Bishop tells the police that he'd given the silver to Valjean as a gift

He then tells Valjean to keep what he has stolen and take more besides

but that he must use the money to become an honest man

Valjean decides to start anew

He breaks his parole and we meet him ten years later as the mayor of a town and a small business owner

However when a new police inspector

Javert

arrives in town

Valjean is recognized as who he is and is forced to confront his past

The rest of the story follows Valjean as he attempts to save a dying prostitute (Fantine) and failing that

raise her orphaned daughter (Cosette) while he eludes the grasp of the single minded Javert

The novel and musical deal with many subpolts however this film narrows it's focus to the central relationship between Valjean an Javert

and the theme of sin and redemption

The acting is by far the film's greatest strength

Liam Neeson portrays Valjean as a good man

but also a flawed man

Many actors fall into the trap of portraying Valjean as a saint- Neeson portrays him as a man struggling with himself and the world

and attempting to let the best of himself dictate his actions

Geoffrey Rush is a perfect foil as Javert

a man who strictly adheres to a moral code

However his rules leave no room for extenuating circumstances

and thus no place for mercy

These conflicting worldviews are the crux of the tension in the film

In a supporting role as Fantine

Uma Thurman is introduced to us as a prostitute desperately trying to support her young daughter who boards with a greedy innkeeper and his wife

We see her sell her hair

her clothes and finally her body to support her child

Her health deteriorates

When we first meet her she is stressed looking

when she finally encounters Valjean she is a wreck of a human being

Looking at her worn expression and the sparkle that appears when she speaks of her daughter the viewer can imagine the beauty she was before the harshness of the world beat her down

Cosette

Fantine's daughter

never really knows the mother who loved her so much

Valjean takes her from the innkeeper and his wife (where we see her being neglected and abused) and raises her as his own

However he never tells her the truth about who her mother was or his own past

As she enters womanhood Cosette knows that there is something her father isn't telling her and is frustrated by his refusal to do so

When she falls in love with a young revolutionary (Marius) she feels the need to hide the relationship from Valjean who she knows would not approve

People criticize Claire Danes for portraying Cosette as \"spoiled\" or \"bratty\" while the character should be sweet and oblivious

I think Danes wisely shows Cosette's love for her adoptive father

her gratefulness to him for all he has given her but is also angry at him for underestimating her intelligence and maturity

The film falters where it deals with the student uprising that preceded the second French revolution

It doesn't have sufficient time to explain the political motivations for events and therefore things feel hastily brushed over

As a character Marius appears to be a cipher

His actions seem completely unmotivated

The editing of these parts feels forced and hastily pieced together

Still Billie August creates an admirable atmosphere and allows Victor Hugo's most important themes to shine through
