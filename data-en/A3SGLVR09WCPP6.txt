I absolutely love this movie

Peggy Sue's memories takes me back to a time of innocence

There were many things in the movie that brought back memories

My sister's boyfriend had a black Impala like Charlie's blue one

In one scene you could see a corner of a Helms Bakery Truck

In Los Angeles

Helms Bakery had a huge bakery in Culver City

They would dispatch trucks all over Los Angeles County

The truck had a little air whistle and we would run out to the truck that had drawers filled with donuts

cookies

bread

cream puffs and cakes that were all baked that morning

The inside of the truck smelled like heaven

I remember my sisters wearing the poodle skirts and scarfs around their necks

What a time

what a time
