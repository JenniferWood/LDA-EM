I would lock myself in the trunk of my car in a heartbeat if Benicio del Toro would come by and steal me and it

I like all the characters in this

and I like all of the actors

Christopher Walken is so good as Uncle Ray

and Harry Connick Jr

plays such a dweeb

but still manages to be cute

Alicia Silverstone is perfect as the pouty rich girl trying to get her dad's attention

This movie is like a fun ride at the amusement park

good for a few go-arounds
