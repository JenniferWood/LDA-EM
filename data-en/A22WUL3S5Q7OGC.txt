This is simply one of the best movies ever produced

whether you are or aren't into &quot;black culture&quot; or movies of this genre

after viewing you

you will most likely atleast be able to appreciate a film

and story like this

I think the majority of people know the story of this movie

if not

you can read reviews from critics

so I will not discuss many points of the movie

If you are looking for an inspirational story from real life

check this out

if you are intersted in teaching in inner cities

check this out

if you are looking for just a good movie that may make you &quot;feel good&quot; then check this out

Morgan Freeman is brilliant in this film

along with many of the student actors

You will laugh

smile

at times be upset at Mr

Clark

and you may even cry

The only problem with this DVD is just that there are not a lot of extra features

However

because the movie is what you buy it for

I will not knock it that much

and

because the DVD can usually be found for under 10 dollars

you can't expect many extra features

Do yourself a favor

and check out this flick

It's one of the best
