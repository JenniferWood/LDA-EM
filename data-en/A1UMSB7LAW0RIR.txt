I'll start right off with the only negative thing I have to say about the movie

The sound is a bit of an issue

or at least it was on both of my televisions

I often had to crank the volume to hear what the characters were saying over the background sounds or music

The first time I watched this

I almost shut it off for that reason

but wow

am I glad I hung in there

This is a great movie

No

I have not read the book although the movie made me try to

I got about fifty pages into the book and was so bored I thought I would pass out

The movie

however

goes well right from the start

Every scene is important and enjoyable

I should admit that I love Liam Neeson

I could watch him paint walls and be happy

but this role totally suited him

He was wonderful

as ever

The rest of the characters were well chosen

too

This weekend I had my teenagers watch Les Miserables and they really enjoyed it as well

It's not stale and boring like a lot classic books turned movie

I think it's one of those movies where you wish you could watch it for the first time

again and again
