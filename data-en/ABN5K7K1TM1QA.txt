This movie is about ten times better than it has any right to be considering how sappy director Penny Marshall could have been tempted to make it

and how phony is the actual baseball played by the young women

(More on this below

)What makes it work are fine performances by Geena Davis as catcher Dottie Hinson

&quot;the best player in the league

&quot; and Lori Petty as her younger sister

Kit Keller

Geena Davis absolutely looks the part with her cool confidence and stately figure while Lori Petty is scrappy and believable as the little sister whose puck and determination set the stage for a sister-rivalry climax at the end

Jon Lovitz as Ernie Capadino

the baseball talent scout

is a crackup as he delivers just about all the best one liners

(Example: he's watching Dottie and Kit milk the cows and asks

&quot;Doesn't that hurt them

&quot; Geena shrugs for the city slicker

&quot;They don't seem to mind

&quot; Ernie thinks about it and then says

&quot;Well

it would bruise the heck out of me

&quot; which was doubly funny since he has his anatomy confused

) But the guy who really holds the whole thing together is Tom Hanks as one-time home run king Jimmy Dugan

who is now the Rockford Peaches' alcoholic manager

I have seen Tom Hanks in a number of films

but I don't think he was ever any better than he is here

His transformation from a crude

uncaring drunk to the team's hard-nosed but soft-hearted leader is very well and believably done

And Hanks was never more charming and seldom funnier

Just as good as the work of the fine cast is Marshall's clear

old-fashioned direction

In many ways this film is a throwback to an earlier time when films set out to warm the hearts of the audience and uplift their spirits

Sure

there is evil in the world and you can't win them all

but you can try

is what this film makes us feel

and if you do

something good will happen

There is of course a somewhat self-conscious retrospective look at the sorry political and social state of women sixty years ago

but Marshall does not wallow in the politics

Instead she emphasizes a fun-to-watch tale with real human characters

The unpredictable

but believable ending was very agreeable

Okay now to some of the problems with the &quot;baseball

&quot; Notice that we first see Kit as a softball pitcher

How she made the transition from throwing underhanded to being one of the best overhand hardball throwers in the league in just a few months is





well

doubtful

And the outfits they wore

Ever try to slide into second trying to break up the double play without sliding pads or even jersey pants

I don't think so

The girls were bare-legged

To Marshall's credit she does show one girl with a huge strawberry bruise on her thigh

Furthermore for those viewers who have actually played baseball

the way many of the young women threw and caught the ball was again

shall we say

doubtful

Marshall employed as extras some young ladies who could actually play a little and we see some shots of their style and grace

but the only star who could even pretend to play at that level would be Rosie O'Donnell

Madonna has some athletic ability

but to imagine her patrolling center field and hauling down long drives strains credibility

Okay

so what

If we put Tom Hanks at bat against even the most mediocre of Class A pitchers

it would be obvious that he is no home run king

In fact

I think Penny Marshall did a great job of creating and maintaining the illusion of Big League skills for the players so that we were not distracted from the story itself

Skillful editing helped

By the way

if they gave Academy Awards for a performance in a role short of a supporting role but longer than a cameo (and maybe they should)

Megan Cavanagh would have won it for her touching impersonation of Marla Hooch

a painfully shy and vulnerable

less than pretty girl from the farm who finds herself as a baseball player in the city as she steals some guy's heart with an unselfconscious

boozy

off-key torch song

I also loved the scene where she is rocketing line drives off the walls and through the windows of the high school gymnasium

Note the appearance of David L

Lander as the radio play-by-play guy

He's best known as the wacky/creepy &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman from the old Laverne and Shirley TV sit-com

Here he plays it mostly straight but does get to wear his hat with the bill up as Leo Gorcey did in the East Side Kids (AKA The Bowery Boys) movies from the early forties

Bottom line here: Uplifting

fun

and even worth seeing again
