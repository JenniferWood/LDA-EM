I find Boorman's direction to be fantastic

As others note two military officers from opposite sides recognize each other

Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water

The tensions

very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out eachother might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three

Mifune showshis tenderness first

But both play outstanding roles

While trying to develop the peace

Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy

Their keen attention to the nonverbals

even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererestedin interpersonal communication

Marvin brings in new vitality once herecognizes there is bamboo on the island

Yielding to each other ina collaborative manner

the raft is built and launched

Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days

Both are exhausted

Discovering the new island is adream

that neither perhaps thought would occur

They forage throughthe deserted military hospital

each finding things of special interest and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each othercountlessly with a big bottle of booze

I wasn't ready for the end buttried to foresee possibilities

For those who can take a movie with verylimited dialogue

scores of nonverbals and two superb actors

this movieis a must

Those who enjoy more group drama or romantic entertainment would be bored

I am glad to have found this movie in my collection

The VHS version plays very well
