Nick Cage

&quot;Special&quot; Secret Agent in &quot;Charge&quot; is really an equal in this little flick; since he's &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; and not wanting to

Probably a bit boring for younger children but certainly nothing they &quot;shouldn't&quot; see

just not enough fun stuff

Tess Carlisle's husband dies during his presidential term in office

Shortly thereafter doctors discover she has an inoperable brain tumor; which she chooses to keep knowledge of to herself

(Tess was an integral part in her husband's running of the White House and it's obvious the acting President knew ) Doug knew it too

Her narcissistic son

played by Edward Albert

from whom she gets no real warmth; appears for a short while because he needs her stamp of approval on a big real estate deal he's scheming

The charisma between the two actors

MacLaine and Cage

shows a very obvious love/hate relationship

Tess wants Doug to continue on as her main &quot;guardian&quot;; whether as punishment or not

I'm not sure

(Doug constantly receives calls from the President threatening to put the agent &quot;in charge&quot; of the White House dog; if he gives Tess a hard time any more

) Agent and ex-First Lady become like mother and son in a very touching scene at a bar of all places

Doug becomes an integral part in her kidnapping outcome

Looking like the true hero is was always meant to be

I love it

Two stubborn personalities dueling with words and &quot;deeds&quot;

Tess is bored and always trying to outsmart her agents

Excellent banter back and forth between them makes me laugh out loud

They happily discover they have much more in common than not

both being basically lonely

Kidnappings

guns going off in hospital rooms

action of one sort or another make it great

Austin Pendleton plays the cagey chauffer

and a suspect in Tess's abduction because he has a burn on his neck that won't be explained away by his stupid story of &quot;terrorists&quot; abducting them
