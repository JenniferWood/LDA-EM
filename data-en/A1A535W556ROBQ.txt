With all the DVD releases of vintage comedies

one has to ask why WKRP remains in VHS only

This was a great comedy

on par with such classic 80's sitcoms as Taxi and Barney Miller

yet it finds itself in video purgatory

along with other great shows of the era such as St

Elsewhere

It took awhile for WKRP to establish an audience

I remember how it got pushed around from one time slot to another

never getting the attention it deserved then

But

it produced such memorable characters

with Loni Anderson

Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman all enjoying success after WKRP

albeit Loni never got as good a role as she had as Jennifer

I suppose it is only a matter of time before we see it on DVD

but it has been an irritatingly long wait
