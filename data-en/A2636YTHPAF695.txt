G'day from Australia

when l found out about the &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; being released

l couldn't wait to get acopy

Close Encounters wont be released here in Australia for quite some months

so thanks to Amazon

com l received a copy from USA

which plays very well on my system here

it was so good to see all the scenes that are removed from the &quot;Special Edition&quot; but l hoped

l really hoped that because it was called the &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; it may include the Special Edition ending sequence as well

but no

l dont know why Steven Spielberg

or whoever

didn't do us fans a favour and edited it all together



oh well it is good to have the Orginal release in the library non the less
