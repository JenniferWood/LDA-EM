Having just seen this movie for the first time last night

I have to say that in spite of the very white actors in a culture that would clearly be darker in appearance

this movie in writing

production

and acting overcame that one glaring inconsistency with accuracy and with beauty

Bible in hand

we marveled to see that this story followed the actual biblical account with astounding accuracy almost never seen in biblical productions

Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece

my entire family loved this movie

We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns

but were startled to see such a wonderful movie

Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance

as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar)

Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances)

Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife

and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous

The supporting cast was excellent

The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh

creative

yet took no liberties in veering from the original story

Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies

this movie was more like it &quot;really&quot; would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence

I can not speak highly enough of this movie

What a pleasant surprise

We even got a chuckle out of it now and then
