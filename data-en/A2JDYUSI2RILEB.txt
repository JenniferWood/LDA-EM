One of Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;commercial&#8221; films of the &#8216;80s

PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED announced to Hollywood that the &#8220;Godfather&#8221; director could shake off the failure of recent cinematic experiments &#8220;One From the Heart&#8221; and &#8220;The Cotton Club&#8221; and package a slick piece of studio filmmaking

Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner&#8217;s script offers a definite &#8220;Back to the Future&#8221;-type feel wherein unhappy domestic housewife Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner) blacks out at her high school reunion and flashes back to life in the idyllic 1950s

There

she&#8217;s able to revisit the past through her adult perspective

realizing that the relationship she has with her high school boyfriend &#8211; and future husband &#8211; Nicolas Cage isn&#8217;t as black or white as she may have remembered

&#8220;Peggy Sue Got Married&#8221; is a very likeable but flawed film with a big

gaping hole at its center in Cage&#8217;s misguided performance

Critics took him to task for his portrayal of Peggy Sue&#8217;s philandering husband and with good reason

as the film nearly sinks under the weight of his overly eccentric character interpretation

Everyone from Kathleen Turner to &#8211; ultimately &#8211; Cage himself derided his performance here

but what&#8217;s worth asking is how much of the blame lies not with the actor but Coppola

Given that Coppola was directing his then-young nephew here

shouldn&#8217;t he have at least given Cage some guidance and said

&#8220;here

tone it down&#8221;

Still

the wistful atmosphere of the picture

punctuated by so many familiar faces (Jim Carrey

Helen Hunt

Catherine Hicks

Kevin J

O&#8217;Connor

even Joan Allen&#8230;who looks middle aged even when she&#8217;s in her high school scenes

)

is impossible to deny

So is the cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth and especially John Barry&#8217;s beautiful score

I had forgotten how much of the film relied on Barry&#8217;s contribution and not just period tunes (there are actually very few songs in the film)

and his effort is bittersweet and lovely &#8211; the antithesis to the nondescript

bland film music of today

Of course

Turner is wonderful as well

giving one of her finest performances

in a movie that offers a very interesting

mature take on a well-worn time travel premise

However

I honestly think the film would&#8217;ve been even more remembered and acclaimed had Cage delivered a performance that could&#8217;ve elevated the material onto a truly emotional level that it only intermittently flirts with

RLJ&#8217;s Blu-Ray of &#8220;Peggy Sue Got Married&#8221; includes an attractive 1080p AVC encode from the Sony vaults that does a fine job conveying the film&#8217;s color scheme and soft lighting&#8230;this isn&#8217;t an especially &#8220;crisp&#8221; looking transfer

but that has more to do with how the film was shot and not an issue with the mastering

The 5

1 DTS MA soundtrack is mostly confined to the front speakers
