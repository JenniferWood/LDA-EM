but somehow I managed to do it in this boxed video series

originally shown on BBC/PBS

Francesca Annis's same-age doctor husband takes a young woman to his medical conference and the young doctor who works for him makes sure his wife finds out

This is because the younger man wants his supervisor's wife for himself

Naturally

the wife has to get even with her husband and after all the young man is THERE







and so we go

It's compelling viewing as all of their lives come blasting apart

I've just bought the sequel

Reckless II

so I can keep apace of even more hanky panky
