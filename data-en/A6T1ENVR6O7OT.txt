Kudos to the producers and writers of this screenplay who managed to avoid the pit-falls of this movie's predecessor - Omega Code

Production values

greatly increased in this attempt

and a human story-line which lasts virtually throughout the first 2/3's of the movie

help to carry it along

More sophisticated writing

editing and directing make the experience far more engaging

while the holes in plot and realism (still present on occasion) are kept to a minimum

While the &quot;Omega Code&quot; suffered greatly from hammy acting

&quot;Megiddo&quot; stars shine

including the performances of each actor who played the Beast at various ages (with deference to Michael York's wonderful portrayal)

a superb performance by Gabrielle (the Beast's Christian wife) and young David (brother to the Beast)

For technical quality

the first half of the movie seems to have shaken the problems inherant to &quot;Omega

&quot; The score was greatly and pleasantly improved the first half

yet regressed the latter during heightened battle scenes

While the final battle scene is visually anti-climatic and long

the anticipated destination of the Beast keeps genuine interest till the end

&quot;Megiddo&quot; may be the best blatantly &quot;Christian&quot; work to date and is worth the trip for the story

Don't go expecting it to be incredible

but perhaps maybe a little surprised
