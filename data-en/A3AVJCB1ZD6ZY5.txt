According to \"League of their Own\"

womens' baseball teams were formed to keep the sports fans happy

So

Rosie had an option for a bat as well as a riveter

\"League of their Own\" is not a completely accurate picture of the life of women during World War II

but it's a very entertaining film about women's self reliance and learning to play on a team
