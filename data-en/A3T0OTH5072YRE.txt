I'm sure everybody starts off their review this way

but there's no crying in baseball

Well

it's a shame I broke that rule several times while I watched this movie

It's just really good at being inspiring and tugging at the heart strings at the same time

In World War II

when a majority of the athletes joined the service and went off to war

the baseball associations brought in women to fill their positions

And at first everyone was skeptical

games weren't selling well and it looked as if the whole notion would be dead on its feet

But then people started paying attention to just how good these girl's were

And history changed

This movie spends time on two sisters who join the league and their ups and downs with the game and each other

Characters:Tom Hanks: Jimmy DuganGeena Davis: Dottie HinsonLori Petty: Kit KellerAnne Ramsey: Helen HaleyMegan Cavanagh: Marla HoochRosie O'Donnell: Doris MurphyTracy Reiner: Betty HornMadonna: Mae MordabitoBitty Schram: Evelyn GardnerThe cast in this movie is fabulous

All of them play their parts so well and you can believe all of them truly love baseball (and if they didn't before the movie they probably do now)

They had a lot of fun out there

Hanks was a convincing alcoholic used to be pro ballplayer turned coach

He has a lot of funny lines

although I'm not sure I enjoyed watching him pee for five minutes

Davis as Dottie was perfect

She had attitude and wasn't actually perfect

She fought with her sister but still loved her

it was very much a real looking sibling relationship

The same with Kit

she was the spoiled little sister who never quite feels good enough when compared to her older sibling

Since that's a feeling a lot of younger siblings have it was very believable

The only characters I couldn't quite get on board with were Rosie O'Donnels and Madonna's

They did an ok job

But I feel like they were there because they were famous and not because they were the best choices for the movie

Normally I'm not big into movies on sports

Unless they're inspiring and about the underdog

Which considering the time period and who was actually playing ball in this movie

they were the underdogs

And I liked that they told some personal stories with the movie too

the sisters and the women with their husbands off at war

It was very emotional and you may tear up several times during the movie

There actually wasn't a ton about the sport itself

it was more about the people who played it

But that just means it would be good for a wider audience

The sets on this film were very authentic

Down to the cars and the clothes they fit into the movie just like you were transported back to the World War II era

Even the music fit the period

I'm glad they took the time to focus on the details and made sure that the movie was just right

A wonderful movie about a group of athletes that you don't think about too much

But just like they won a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame

this movie should also win a spot on your to-watch list
