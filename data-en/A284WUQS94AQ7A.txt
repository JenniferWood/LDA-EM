This by far is the most visually perfect movie ever made

A definite feast for your eyes

It is truly amazing how perfect the special effects are to this day

The magic in this Steven Spielberg movie will never be outdated

I saw this in the theater in 1977 and it impressed me then

and still to this day keeps me in awe

This tale of a UFO encounter takes the audience on a trip to discover that we are not alone

This movie is a must for everyone to see

It is my ultimate favorite film

I do believe we are not alone
