My cable service gave Lean on Me two stars

I don't know the basis of their rating system

frankly

but I don't see how Lean on Me could be considered a \"two star\" film

This movie

based on a true story

is an account of how a rough

strict

demanding

politically-incorrect principal managed to turn around and clean up an inner-city school which had been out of control and overrun with violence and drugs

It stars Morgan Freeman

who is his usual

brilliant self

and a number of supporting actors who each do a quality job (notably

Robert Guillaume)

The writing is good

the pacing is quick but not rushed and the technical elements all serve their various ends

Sure

you could say it's \"fairly standard Hollywood fare\"--there aren't a whole lot of twists and turns

and the good guys win in the end

pretty much on schedule

But

when you present a real life story

you are rather constrained in what you can manage

This

in particular

is the tale of Joe Clark who actually did these things

This film captures well a true tale

presents it faithfully with a good script and good acting

It's hard to see how we can ask for very much more than that

Four stars
