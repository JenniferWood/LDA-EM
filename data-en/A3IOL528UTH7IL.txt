This has alway been my all time favorite movie

I remember my mom and I were in Blockbuster Video store when I was nine

and she and I couldn't find anything

Then

she saw &quot;A League of Their Own

&quot; she told me that I would love this movie

And boy was she right

I have seen this movie over 50 times

I know the entire dialogue

the songs

every moment

I can rehash line for line right now if I wanted to

I think this movie had the most well-rounded cast in over a decade

Geena Davis was amazing as Dottie Henson; a person who loved the game very much

although she tried to pull off that she didn't

Lorri Petty's best role to date

as Kit Keller

Dottie's younger sister

whom is always stuck in Dottie's shadow

The chemistry between Petty and Davis is amazing

they work so well together

they were extremely believable

Tom Hanks was fantastic as the alcoholic

ex-baseball star Jimmy Dugan

which of course

his classic urinating seen is a total laugh

Madonna and Rosie had made the laughs of the film

they were wise cracking and hilarious

I can go on and on about this film

and the problem is

I can't quite articulate how much I love this film

and why I love it so much

I've cried many times

especially the scene with Betty &quot;Spighetti&quot; and at the end of the World Series

I love this film

Penny Marshall is a Goddess

She chose the perfect actors

and the perfect score

especially Madonna's &quot;Playground&quot; which still makes me cry at the ending sequences

This movie observes a part of history that is ignored

Many to this day

have no idea about the professional baseball league

grant it

this movie &quot;idealized&quot; what really happened

but it made you proud

I think this is still a must-see of a movie

it is still my all-time favorite movie

and it has been for 11 years
