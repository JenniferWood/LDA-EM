This is one of those typically smug

self satisfied

Generation X 90's films

a film that gleefully shows the dark side of human nature but not in an interesting or an artistic way

It seems LaBute just wanted to show how nasty he could be

Believe me

I am not an overly sensitive

politically correct leftie or anything

I am a deep admirer of Catherine Breillat and Ingmar Bergman

and their films are not very happy

I do not accept the self indulgence which is on display here

This film reminds me of another piece of garbage film called Very Bad Things

Some critics and moviegoers liked that film because they thought it was just a very dark comedy

It wasn't

It was a sadistic

smarmy film that reveled in its cruelty without any intelligence behind it

This film really doesn't feel misogynistic to me

The humiliation of the woman isn't really why I dislike the film so much

It's the attitude towards the audience

It just feels like LaBute just killed something

and is forcing you to watch it over and over again

and he keeps saying \"that's the way the world is baby

Hahahaha

\"

There's a ridiculous scene (which Roger Ebert thought was brilliant for some demented reason) where Aaron Eckhart forces a black employee to drop his pants

There's no point to the scene

and it doesn't even fit in with the rest of the film

just in terms of the narrative

A lot of people compared this film to a Kubrick film

and it is deeply insulting to Kubrick (and to fans of his

of which I include myself)

Kubrick's films were injected with an artistry and intelligence that this film sorely lacks

LaBute's next film

Your Friends and Neighbors

was a bit better

but that too had a \"shocking\" scene in which Jason Patric talked about gleefully raping a man

Don't believe the hype of this film

It's not worth seeing
