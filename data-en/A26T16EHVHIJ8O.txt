Close Encounters of the Third Kind has lost none of the magic that made it such a favorite of mine 23 years ago when it first hit the big screen

Spielberg came up with the novel idea that perhaps &quot;invading&quot; aliens needn't be hostile

Nevertheless communication between alien species can't be easy

They don't quite know how to go about contacting us and become a bit of a 'bull in a china shop

' Their methods are inexplicable and cause somewhat of a tumult on Earth

but that's why they're aliens

right

We're not the same

Why should we expect them to think the same as we do

with the same respect for personal boundaries and behavior

The complexity that went into the creation of the aliens' behavior and culture is one of the things that makes this movie so interesting

Richard Dreyfuss

still spry and angst-ridden in his youth

is terrific as Roy Neary

an electrician whose contact with the aliens leads him to obsession and ruins his domestic life

Of course

the most enjoyable scene in the movie is the first real contact between humanity and the aliens with the best part of the musical score on display

The only thing missing on this DVD is the option to view the movie INCLUDING the missing scenes like the ones aboard the spacecraft

You can view the deleted scenes

but it would have been nice to view them as part of the movie as we were able to do when a special edition of the film was released back in the early 80's

Still

great job and beautiful digital transfer

This one's a classic
