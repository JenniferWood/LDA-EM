I really can't even remember what it was that I expected when I first saw ads for Guarding Tess

I definitely remember that it wasn't much

This film has so much heart and character that its impossible to resist

Shirley McLaine (Tess Carlisle) is the former first lady of a now deceased president

Nicholas Cage (Doug Chesnik) is the head secret service agent assigned to 'guard' the former first lady

Tess is a rather crochety seemingly self absorbed old girl and agent Chesnik is a by the book G-man

While Tess does her level best to break all the rules and drive Doug crazy

Doug yearns to be on a 'real' assignment

He hates the non structured nature of guarding someone like Tess

What each of them realizes along the way is how much they care for one another and how much they bring to the others life

And along the way we are introduced to an ecclectic group of characters who will endear themselves to your heart and have you chuckling at many of their antics

You'll laugh

cry and feel for all the characters in this gem of a film

So why only 4 stars then

Because despite its genuine warmth and humor I found the story to be a bit contrived and somewhat unbelievable

All that notwithstanding it shouldn't be missed
