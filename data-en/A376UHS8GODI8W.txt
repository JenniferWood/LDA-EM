I bought the very same product on VHS tape (in widescreen)

I had hoped that this would truly make it an enhanced viewing experience

since it was on DVD

Yes

it comes in a 2-DVD package

although the container itself is stupid to say the least

A flip-flop tray that has to be pulled out of a sleeve

The second DVD doesn't offer much more

than the specials already included at the end of the videotape

Granted

the sound is a bit better than its VHS counterpart

but was it worth it

NO

Let me just compare it with the \"LEGEND - Special Edition\" 2-DVD release

What did you get in that one

First of all

since there were two versions of the \"LEGEND\" movie (a Europen/International and a U

S

version)

you got them both

Same feature was included in the \"ALIEN\" superbox

in which one got the theatrical releases and the special/director's cuts

back to back and in the \"X-MEN\" superbox

in which you can easily \"reintegrate\" the cut scenes of the theatrical versions with a push on your remote control

Here you just receive Steven Spielberg's original vision and the cut/additional scenes are left to a special by itself

included in DVD 2

The special contents are the very same as the ones included

as said earlier

at the end of the tape

The interview with Spielberg is tedious and disenchanting

A man consumed by too much success speaks out and seems almost bored with what seems to have been his masterpiece of all times

A man that has lost his original vision and is disenchanted with his own ideals of yesteryear is not very interesting at all

He's just old

To impose it then to his \"fans





\" is stupid to say the least

Maybe he is tired

maybe he is just plainly being sarcastic

or so I hope

'cause if it is what the man truly feels about producing and directing his own movies (and having an extreme amount of luck in being able to do so at all

while many never get a chance in their lifetimes)

seems like a slap in the face to those who have admired his work and his talent

I

having watched the interview felt personally offended by his reviewed vision of things

Maybe I lack the \"maturity





\" he has achieved

Nevertheless

I bought this

let me say

junk of a movie

I even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented

when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it

It hasn't improved one bit

being transferred onto DVD

It just sits there

in my shelf

gathering dust

I wanted to buy \"E

T

- The Extra-Terrestrial\" Special Edition

but having seen this

I suspect it's the same-o

same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago

Nor am I enthused to have

as a special

the score conducted live by John Williams either

I'll rather wait until the \"live\" score will appear on audio CD one day

and then again

the question will still remain

will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did

As said

the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years

made me think

and when I think

it is not usually a good thing

I sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind

These are things that irritate me immensely

It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain \"youth junk\"

Sorry Mr

Spielberg

a man that loses faith in his own visions

after having founded a family or not

has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you)

or he is plainly tired of his life as it is

in which case my honest suggestion would be

to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge

I have always detested winers

especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it

Please take a moment and think about it

Mr

Spielberg

Who made you what you are

The Studios

The Executives

The Backers

Or we

the audience

Think

and think hard

Sorry

I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety)

with more uplifting and more interesting specials

I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his/her money in a clever \"rehash\" of the very same product

By the way

since I am already at it

Please studios

distributors

directors and producers

do us all a big

immense favor

Stop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings

when the product itself is always the same

It's a waste of time

talent

taste

money and a complete lack of true intelligence

creativity and intuitiveness

I can only suppose that you are all better than that

so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us

the audience

better and more thoroughly thought of products

You only stand to gain from it

Just remember what Abraham Lincoln said:\"You can fool all the people some of the time

and some of the people all the time

but you cannot fool all the people all the time

\"A bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order

Do not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people

Unfortunately for you

there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds

There are even some

able to read between the lines

So

please

become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers

but rather chosers of your fate

Yes

because ultimately it is us

the customers

who decide whether you have another day in business or not

not your fancy peers

nor your elegant

Armani clad

shareholders

Keep that in mind

and you will be in business forever

Forget it

and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate

and as we all know

fate cannot be influenced by one man alone

This is it

Buy it

my fellow customers

if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs

Refrain

if every penny is dear to you

There are far better movies around

This is just an old myth and getting older by the minute
