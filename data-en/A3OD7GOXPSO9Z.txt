I will not go into detail on how I feel about Steven Spielberg's wonderful science-fiction odyssey

probably one of the best movies ever made and a classic in the science-fiction genre

despite what the knucklehead academics say

Instead

I will address the minor controversy surrounding the Blu-Ray editions of the movie

As everyone knows

there are two types of Blu-Ray editions of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"

One is the 30th anniversary box set

which includes the three versions of the movie (Theatrical

Special Edition and Director's Cut) on one disc; a plethora of bonus features on the second; and a booklet (the 3-disc DVD version of the set contains one version on one disc each

a making-of documentary scattered on all the discs

and the rest of the bonus features on the director's cut disc)

The other is the cheaper

newly released \"Blu-Ray Essentials\" version

which only contains the first disc of all the three versions but no booklet and zero bonus features (except for the Blu-Ray exclusive \"A View from Above\" feature

whose main purpose is to show viewers the difference between all three versions)

The reason I'm addressing this is because some Amazon

com reviewers (including myself) have expressed dismay over buying the wrong edition

Unlike these reviewers

I am not entirely angered by this since I already have the 30th anniversary edition on DVD and that I bought the \"Essentials\" version just to upgrade to Blu-Ray (it also helped that it was on sale for a meager $7)

But I can understand the frustrations looming in the reviews section and I wish Amazon would have notified this and state the differences

If you're going to upgrade to Blu-Ray and want to learn the history behind \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"

it's highly recommended you buy the 30th Anniversary box set

However

if you just want to buy \"Close Encounters\" primarily for the picture and audio quality and have no care for the extras

the \"Blu-Ray Essentials\" version will serve you well

It also helps that it's much cheaper than the other set (at least

at this moment)

Either way

this movie is a dazzler on Blu-Ray

Columbia did a phenomenal job restoring \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" in its best condition

The picture quality is superb and the audio is dazzling

particularly on the surround sound speakers

Some reviewers complained about the existence of grain

but this movie was shot on celluloid

not digital photography

so

of course

the grain is inevitable

Even so

it shouldn't distract from the incredible experience you'll have while watching this terrific movie on Blu-Ray and with a big screen TV

When the alien mothership lands on the Devil's Tower in the movie's climax

you'll feel the experience like no other in the previous VHS and DVD versions

\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" belongs in every movie collection and now thanks to Blu-Ray

it looks and sounds better than ever

If you are hesitant to replace your DVD player with a Blu-Ray player

then this version of this film should force your hand

Strongest recommendation
