Now

clearly the musical is far superior from this movie and I've never read the book

but from what I can gather from reviews and research on the book

they've butchered it a lot

They're are a few things I like

Okay

maybe a little less then a few

-It shows a little more of a relationship between Valjean and Fantine

Okay

the romantic part of it was a little over the top

but it showed at least more of a relationship and more buildup before Valjean said he'd take Cosette

In the musical

it feels like Valjean just walks into the hospital and sees Fantine

who asks him to take care of her daughter

and Valjean says

\"Okay

random stranger

I'll take care of your daughter even though I don't know who you are

\"-The movie more realistically portrays Fantine

I loved Lea Salonga and Ruthie Henshell as Fantine

but they were a little too pretty for someone who had just cut off their hair

sold some teeth

and was now a prostitute

And besides that

Uma Thurman was a fantastic Fantine

And now for the cons of this movie

-Liam Neeson could have played a good Valjean if they had written the character out correctly

In the musical

Valjean is portrayed as gentle and kind

He cares for people

even if he doesn't know them

In this

he's kind of violent

I don't know how many people he hit

slapped

etc



how many people ended up with a bloody nose because of him

but it wasn't that realistic

He didn't die at the end of the movie

as he should have

And WHY oh WHY did he walk away SMILING after he watched Javert commit SUICIDE

What



I don't care if I didn't like the person; I would not walk away SMILING after someone just committed suicide in front of me

-Javert is portrayed as so antagonistic it's unbearable

He's not supposed to be the favorite character of the play/book

but he's supposed to have turned hard from a rough life

He is

in a sense

the antagonist to the protagonist Valjean

But in this

he's like a complete villain

He wouldn't hold Cosette hostage just to capture Valjean

I mean

yeah

he's all the law and all the order

but in this he's like an OCD freak: \"Must catch Valjean

must catch Valjean

\"-What was up with Marius

I'll get my teenage-girl out of me

but he wasn't even CUTE

How could Cosette be attracted to him

He looked like a hippie

And he was so out of character I can't even tell you

He took over Enjolras's role (thus reducing Enjolras's role in the film to about a minute of screentime

) He was a reluctant participant in the revolution

not the leader

-Where was Eponine

Really

Seeing her for about two minutes when she's playing with Azelma

Wow

Eponine's my favorite character and her story with Marius is tragic

Would it have killed the producers to add in Eponine's character

It's a good movie to watch if you're going to see the musical and you've never read the book

It will give you a basic outline of the story (somewhat unrealistically

but I digress

) The acting is good and the script is okay

But if you are a loyal Les Mis book/musical lover

it's not great
