Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle

I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons

It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy

Well written

well acted

well designed

I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men

I bet if anyone asked her

she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career

I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent

Great fun
