'Godzilla vs

Mothra' is one of my favorite in the Godzilla series

It is still early enough (1964) to be serious

yet more decidedly less dark in tone than the original

In this one Godzilla is still a bad guy

and Mothra

a giant moth

is summoned from Monster Island with the help of two miniature singing muses and some natives

Ultimately Mothra almost overcomes Godzilla with some great rubber monster fights along the way (and all the toy airplanes

tanks

boats

etc



that comes with them)

but it is a 'Lion King' (or &quot;Circle of Life&quot;

if you prefer) moment as Mothra dies atop her egg

which is being coaxed to hatch by some very imaginative chanting

The two grubs that emerge from the egg are out for vengeance and taunt Godzilla with several wily maneuvers before cocooning him in silk and dumping him into the ocean

The sight of the two grubs swimming off into the sunset is particularly delicious for fans of the series

The movie is well made for the era

and I think the English dubbing is better than in most of the Godzilla films

Likewise the script is more mature than the bulk of the Godzilla series

which in general I like

although it becomes a bit preachy about the anti-nuclear stuff (Ishiro Honda is the greatest director of the Japanese monster movies

but subtlety is not one of his more admired filmmaking attributes

) The film does

however

serve its desired function as a comment on greed and avarice admirably

I recommend 'Godzilla vs

Mothra' highly

and no fan of Japanese cinema or monster movies should be without it

It is available as a single DVD or part of a Godzilla five-pack

which I recommend highly: it's a bargain at any price
