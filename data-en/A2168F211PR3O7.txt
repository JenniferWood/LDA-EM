And the ladies can handle a real life situation

make us laugh

and together give us many happy and sad moments at the same time

As I watched this movie my ribs ached laughing so much while at the same time a tear rolled down my cheek

In 1943 when most of the men of baseball playing age suddenly had their life interrupted fighting in Europe and Asia during World War II

the ladies stepped in to keep the love of baseball alive

And so an action packed exciting baseball story unfolds as a candy-bar tycoon enlists agents to scour the country to find women who can play baseball

And a one time home run champion

Jimmy Duggan

played by Tom Hanks

who is now a broken-down alcoholic is solicited to manage the team

This is an excellent movie with lots of comedy and a superb casts of players

Don't ever count women out when it comes time to play a significant role in life

nor a left from behind baseball champion turned derelict

It's an entertaining baseball story for all ages

and I like surprises
