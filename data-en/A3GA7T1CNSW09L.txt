There are all 3 versions included in this offering

The Blu-Ray transfer seems to maybe have been done mostly for the original version

There are places in the Special Edition and Director's cut versions that seem NOT to have been put through the Blu-Ray process





for example

in the darker scenes the graininess seems more evident

When Roy Neary is out at those R/R tracks and is lost and has his Encounter of the 2nd kind

there is quite a lot of graininess going on

Also at the beginning in the sandstorm and for other \"night\" scenes





however

during the rest of the film the picture is really great

So

once again it looks as though the people doing the Blu-Ray transfer AGAIN cut corners and tried to save money by not applying the process to the whole film

- Bottom line

this is a great movie and I think I can overlook the fact it is not perfect and still enjoy all 3 versions

But

the PQ is not pristine nor perfect

just mostly great
