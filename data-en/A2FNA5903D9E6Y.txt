This film is so frightening because one can imagine these things actually happening

I needed to watch the film twice before I got it all

Basically

two corporate men decide to date a wallflower for six weeks and then dump her

breaking her heart in the most cruel way

essentially getting revenge on all of womankind for past wrongs

In this case

the wallflower is a deaf girl who is a typist in a very bleak corporate office the two men are sent to work in for six weeks

This film is so cleverly written that there were moments (the first time I watched it) when I felt that Chad (the handsome one) was actually falling for this poor girl but at the end

and then on the second viewing

I realized that he was just planting the idea that he might really have feelings for this girl in his co-worker's mind in order to manipulate him (that would be Howard - the less handsome one)

Making Howard believe that he might really have feelings for this deaf woman only made her more desirable (to Howard) - male competition in play

I also felt that he was trying to undermine Howard's authority as his boss because of his jealousy - needing to sabotage that aspect as well

Though some elements of the film are cliche (the girl falls for the good-looking one of course

then the nerdy one has a breakdown)

these things

again

actually happen in real life (I know a lot of women who would choose a macho handsome guy over a sensitive nerdy guy just on looks alone - the same as a man picking a beautiful woman with a so-so personality over an average-looking woman who is really smart)

Though most viewers feel really bad for this woman

she actually played her own game by dating both men simultaneously even after telling Chad that she loved him

She reasons that after not dating for a long time

she liked the attention - it made her feel attractive again

Some people feel bad for Howard but really

he wasn't in love with this girl either though he may have thought so - it was just beating Chad (and being on the rebound) that drove his competitive side to move forward so aggressively

I mean

after dating her for a few weeks

he gives her a used engagement ring and then freaks out telling her that it was all a game when she rejects him

If he really loved and wanted her

he would have tried to protect her from the truth (instead

he uses it as a weapon against her almost as if he is punishing her for the way his former fiance treated him

It seemed to me that he was subconsciouly getting revenge on his former fiance through this woman - that she had in essence become the fiance that rejected him and so the game actually did what it set out to do)

Theories like \"what goes around comes around\" don't apply here and the most disturbing thing about this movie is the reality that what goes around doesn't always come around especially in Chad's case - that he lies

plots

schemes and destroys with no repercussions

In the end

he goes home to his beautiful apartment

his beautiful girlfriend

his great job and everything is as it ever was

And sadly

that's real life
