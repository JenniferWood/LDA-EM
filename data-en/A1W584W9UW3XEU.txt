TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of Joseph

betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers

Martin Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate performances

with the role of Joseph also well-acted

Leslie-Anne Warren is the lustful wife of Potiphar

who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph

and lands him in the Pharoah's prison

This film offers a very credible depiction of life in the ancient Near East

from the desert tents of the Hebrews

to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem

to the lushness of civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court

The film is faithful to the Biblical account

and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen

A well-acted

well-scripted

and entertaining film

END
