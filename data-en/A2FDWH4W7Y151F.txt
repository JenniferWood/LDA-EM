Truth Or Consequences

New Mexico was a good movie

But by 1997 when this movie came out people are just tired of all the post Tarantino-espe movies

This had the basic plot

robbery gone bad

Criminals fight with each other

one of the guys is an undercover cop

Mob wants them

FBI want them

and of course one of the mob guys is a deranged psycho (Martin Sheen in this movie) and of course the big shoot out at the end

The action and violence is really well done

Opening shoot out and the ending shootout is great and really makes up for the rehash plot

Vincent Gallo was just wrong for the part

He isn't a great actor to begin with

but you just didn't care for him or the loveof he had for his girlfriend

The closing sequence just didn't get me as it should have

Martin Sheen is not believable as &quot;Psycho finger cutting&quot; Mob main bag man

You just could not take this scene seriously

Rod Steiger has as a small role as a crime boss and puts on a scene stealing performance

Worth renting

but not worth putting in your collection

If you like gory shootouts then this movie is for you though
