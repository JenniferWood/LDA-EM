When this first aired in 1979

I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;

I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year

When I finally got a copy on VHS

I got that wish

Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad

To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods

Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD

this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen

It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago

and this way it will live forever

Get it now and on disc before it gets away
