I remember watching this movie in great amazement when I was a child

It is such a great movie

When I'd heard that it would be on DVD I had to rush out and get it

I watched it with my ten year old stepson and he watched it with the same enthusiasm that I remember in myself

Close Encounter's is truly one on the classics

A wonderful movie to watch with your family

If you've not seen it

you need to
