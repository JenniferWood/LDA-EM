This has got to be my favorite movie of all time

I was a big fastpitch player back in middle school and high school and when this movie came out I was pretty excited

Great actors

great story

and inspiring that it was actually based on a true story

Movies just aren't as good now-a-days like they used to be back in the 80s and 90s

This is a must see
