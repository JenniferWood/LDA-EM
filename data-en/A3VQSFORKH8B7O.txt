After seeing THE OMEGA CODE

which I gave three stars for very little drama and cheesy visual effects

I found this to be a very refreshing look at the time which will be coming

For a film that cost only $20 Million to make

the film has awesome visual effects

and plenty of 'em

The storytelling was very different

actually putting in a good amount of characterization and plot

It is at times dramatic

and at times terrifying

The acting was very good (Michael York is MUCH better as Stone Alexander in this film than in THE OMEGA CODE)

Michael Biehn gives the best performance of his career as David Alexander

Stone's brother

Anybody who liked THE OMEGA CODE

or like movies with excitement

drama

and mind-riveting storytelling

will love this movie

I guarantee it

Grade: A+
