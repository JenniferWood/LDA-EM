Though this is a well-made documentary on Anne Frank

author ofThe Diary of a Young Girl

I personally feelAnne Frank Rememberedpacks a more emotional punch whilst tracing the life of this remarkable young woman who perished too young at the hands of the monstrous Nazis

Anne Frank was a pretty and intelligent young girl who together with her family had to suffer persecution at the hands of the Nazis because they were Jewish

The family went into hiding when Anne was thirteen and they remained in hiding for more than 2 years before they were betrayed and arrested by the Nazis

Anne eventually died of typhus in Bergen Belsen concentration camp

and of her family

only her father Otto survived the Holocaust

This A&E; Biography of Anne is well-produced and provides interesting insights into Anne's life

There are interviews with Anne's father and one of their friends (who helped them whilst they were in hiding)

Miep Gies

a woman of remarkable courage and compassion

It also covers the period after the Franks' arrest

There is no definitive production out there which provides a comprehensive picture of Anne's life before

during and after hiding

Besides the documentary mentioned above

I would recommend two fictional dramatizations of Anne

i

e

Anne Frank - The Whole Storywhich is faithful to \"The Diary of a Young Girl\" and also provides a compelling reimagining of what happened to Anne and her family after they were arrested

right up to the moment of her death

The other production which is relatively new yet well-made

isThe Diary of Anne Frank (As Seen On BBC)

These two productions try to be as faithful as they can to the actual story of Anne and I highly recommend them for those who would like to gain a better understanding of Anne's life and writing

Of course

there are many books on the subject

Besides the diary itself

there's:Anne Frank: Beyond the Diary - A Photographic RemembranceAnne Frank's Tales from the Secret AnnexInside Anne Frank's House: An Illustrated Journey Through Anne's WorldAnne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped to Hide the Frank FamilyThe Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition
