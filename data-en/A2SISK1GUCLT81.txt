I have really enjoyed and loved this 1998 film version since it came out (and

in fact

watched it days before seeing the musical version

and thought

in my own humble opinion

that it was far better than the new musical one)

and discovered it anew in it's Blu-Ray format

It looks pretty good- not the best transfer to Blu-Ray I've seen

but a huge upgrade from the original DVD release

The performances are all great

and having read the book as well

missed all the cut subplots and all

but still

they captured the essence of Hugo's towering novel

and I at least I didn't feel like screaming at the screen

&#34;Stop Singing&#34;







(And I enjoy musicals too







but this one







OYE

)
