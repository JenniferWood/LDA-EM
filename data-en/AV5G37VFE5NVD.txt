There have been three \"series\" of Godzilla movies: the Showa series

which includes all films released from 1954-1975

the Heisei series

which includes all films released from 1984-1995

and the Millennium series

which includes all films released from 1999-2004

The Showa series holds all the classics

and excluding the original

nothing is more classic than 1964's MOTHRA VS

GODZILLA

Much like GOLDFINGER (released the same year)

which was almost universally considered to be the finest James Bond film prior to the release of CASINO ROYALE

by all explanations MOTHRA VS

GODZILLA shouldn't be so good

Nevertheless

it is inexplicably the finest sequel in the Showa series

The plot involves a mysterious giant egg that washes up on the shores of Japan

attracting the attention of greedy businessmen who \"purchase\" the egg

Meanwhile

a scientist

a reporter

and a rookie photographer are trying to discover what the egg really belongs to when they encounter two small fairies

who tell them that the egg is Mothra's egg

Mothra is

of course

a giant moth

who made her debut in her own kaiju flick

1961's MOTHRA (also directed by the great Ishiro Honda)

Though the trio tries to convince the businessmen to return the egg to Mothra

they will do no such thing

Then who emerges to liven things up but the Big G himself

looking more ferocious than he did before or did in any film afterwards

Can Mothra protect her egg and save Japan from the menace of Godzilla

or will Japan's worst (and biggest) enemy be having scrambled eggs for his next entree

Ishiro Honda really knew what he was doing with this film

The pacing is perfect: not too rushed

but not slow to the point where one begins screaming for a monster to pop up and wreak some havoc

The screenplay is humorous and very fun

and Akira Ifukube's music is spectacular

The Godzilla suit used for this film

\"Mosugoji\"

is a fan favorite due to its more nasty

reptilian look

Mothra herself is a seemingly silly opponent

but her battle(s) with Godzilla are surprisingly interesting

The best scene of the film is Godzilla's first appearance

sudden

with no foreshadowing

I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen the film

but it's my favorite Godzilla entrance ever

I cannot congratulate Sony Wonder enough for their recent Godzilla DVD releases

For a longtime fan like me

they're a dream come true - gorgeous packaging

delectable restoration

sumptuous bonus features

and both the Japanese AND English version (the English version of MOTHRA VS

GODZILLA

titled GODZILLA VS

THE THING

actually contains extra footage not in the Japanese version

)

It's quite the package; if you're a Godzilla fan

don't hesitate to pick it up

MOTHRA VS

GODZILLA is the best sequel of the Showa series

and a reminder of just how fun \"evil Godzilla\" was before the series descended into silliness with the subsequent entries
