Though it's been a while

I recall this as being a rather excellent film

Peter Chattaway tells us that \"disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent

challenging and convincing

it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection

1996)
