Steven Spielberg read my mind

I must have come up with same story in my dreams and thinking because when I saw it the first time

I was aghast at how closely it resembled my hopes and ideas about alien encounters

I love this movie and can watch it over and over

Richard Dreyfuss gives

what I consider

the best performance of his career

Teri Garr was great for the part

but I fell in love with Melinda Dillon

If it ever happens

let it happen something like this

Kudos to Mr

Spielberg for his insight and knowing exactly how to put it together
