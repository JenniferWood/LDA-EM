This version is basically the 1980 &quot;Special Edition&quot; without the ridiculous &quot;inside the Mother Ship&quot; sequence at the end

All of the other scenes added for the special edition (The ship in the desert and the additional scenes of Roy Neary's breakdown) are here

The main scene cut from the original version

which shows Roy Neary at work at the power station is still missing

but it is present as one of 11 deleted scenes on the second disk of this set

Most of these scenes were justifiably cut from the film

adding nothing to the story

Most interesting is an alternate meeting between Bob Balaban and Francios Truffaut in a limousine at an airport

Similar dialog but different

This scene was clearly meant to follow the air traffic control scene that is still in the movie

Also includes the obligatory &quot;Making of Documentary

clearly shot at the same time as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; as Spielberg is filmed in front of a debris strewn European street

This is a first class DVD presentation

I just wish that they could have done what they did with &quot;The Abyss&quot; and include BOTH versions of the film
