This is the first time that I thought a movie was not worth seeing and waited until it hit a premium movie channel

This time I will admit I made a mistake

This movie was fun to watch

It is well written and the interactions of the two main actors show a great chemistry

Nicolas Cage plays the Special Agent in Charge of the Secret Service detail guarding a former First Lady

The First Lady is played well my Shirley MacLaine

The agent feels he is wasted in such a detail and wants desperately to get back on detail to the White House





and the First Lady wants him to stay

The two seem to thrive on confrontation with each other

She does her best to break every procedure the Secret Service is supposed to follow

If you pay attention in the movie you will see why the First Lady actually loves the agent so much and wants him with her

And I think the picture shows us a very accurate relationship that occurs between agent and his protectee

Though it could be seen as a comedy; there is a just enough drama and a mystery which Cage character solves

A very well directed with perfect pace and timing

I look forward to buying it and watching it again
