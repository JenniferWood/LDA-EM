A wonderfully told story has Dupree (as Miss Fortune

) playing an elderly woman who is painfully lonely

While traveling on a European train

she meets a rather unusual family of charming connivers

They've just been kicked out of the Riviera

and see this rich

lonely old woman as their next meal ticket





Dupree

however

isn't the easy pushover the con artists were hoping for

and they learn about a little thing called w-o-r-k

The story is told with sensitivity and the right amount of humour: the results are charming & heart-warming

The original ending had Miss Fortune dying

but this proved unfavourable to preview audiences

so the cast was called back to film a more upbeat

happier ending

The photography and music are both excellent and garnered AA nominations
