I am not a alien's among us freak

I love this movie because the combination of acting and storytelling were equal to the special effects of our time

We live in an age of where poor story telling is allowed because the special effects are so good people don't complain: especially when it comes to SyFy





Saaaaad

but you will enjoy this film as its true value is the storytelling and not the subject matter
