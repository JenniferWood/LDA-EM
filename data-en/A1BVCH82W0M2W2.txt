When you stop and think about it out of the thousands upon thousands of feature films that have been made over the decades only a relative handful have been about baseball

I think that the best baseball film ever made was \"Eight Men Out\" which tells the story of the 1919 Black Sox scandal

Also high on my list of faves are \"The Natural\"

\"Field of Dreams\"

\"Bang The Drum Slowly\" and the 1992 comedy-drama \"A League of Their Own\"

In case you are not familiar with this film \"A League of Their Own\" stars Tom Hanks and Geena Davis and recalls the story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League which operated in several midwestern cities from 1943-1954

I fell in love with this film the first time I saw it more than 15 years ago

The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was a by-product of World War II

For a time in the early 1940's it appeared the Major League Baseball might actually have to shut down because so many of its players were going overseas to fight

A group of investors decided that a girls professional league might just be the ticket to temporarily fill the void being left by the men

Although this is a fictionalized account of the AAGPBL you will come away from this film with a pretty good idea of what took place all those years ago

What began as an experiment actually lasted for more than a decade

Tom Hanks stars as Rockford Peaches manager Jimmy Dugan

a retired all-star player whose career was cut short by the bottle

The film also stars Geena Davis in the role of Dottie Hinson star catcher for the Peaches and Madonna as the rough and tumble center fielder \"All the Way\" Mae Mordabito

But for me Lori Petty clearly steals the show as Dottie Hinson's insecure kid sister Kit who also plays for the Peaches

Director Penny Marshall does a spendid job here and I found myself really beginning to care a great deal about all of these charactors during the course of this fine motion picture

If you are like me you will experience the full range of emotions watching \"A League of Their Own\"

You will laugh out loud

cheer on the team and even shed a tear or two along the way

Although the All-American Girl's Professional Baseball League is no more its legacy lives on at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown NY

I have seen the exhibit and it is quite impressive indeed

\"A League of Their Own\" is one of those rare films that can be seen and enjoyed by the entire family

There really is something in this film for just about everyone

I find that I enjoy this film more each time I see it

Very highly recommended
