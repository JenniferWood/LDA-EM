Morgan Freeman gives one compelling performance in Lean On Me

He really captures the spirit of Joe Clark in portraying the turn around at East Side High

The film is loaded with dynamics

The scene where he shows Sams that he is no fool and dares him jump is a bit unrealistic and even inappropriate

but you got to admit it makes a point

It dares Sams to make a change if though it takes some time

The chaining fo the fire doors and the confrontations with the drug dealers also add fire if not totally realistic

The many moments of heated confrontations between Clark

the teachers

the students

and the school board parents will definitely keep an audience listening

It delivers a good message that one man with a strong will can certainly accomplish a great deal

Realism aside this is a good movie

And anyone

does everything have to be so practical
