Of all the TNT movies

this one is actually the weakest

But it is still a good movie

The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau

The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel

The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about

but not focused on

The non-Scriptural parts

though

were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding

In that way

it was very good

If you choose to watch this movie

you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't

It is a good movie and well produced

Just be sure you don't base much theology on it

;-)The movie is a solid PG movie
