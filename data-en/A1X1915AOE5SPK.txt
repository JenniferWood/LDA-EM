Wow what a great movie

The actors in it are wonderful Tom Hanks

Madonna

Rosie O'Donnel what more could you ask for people

This movie really shows what women can do

very inspiring

I love the part when they poison the chaparone person and they sneak off to go dancing

I thought it was funny :)

Its a really good movie especially for women
