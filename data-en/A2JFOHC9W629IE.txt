I loved the series

and I would have put my collection together a little differently

but so would anyone

One myth that has been perpetrated here has to stop: The Consultant was NOT one of the better episodes

Yes

it had a really good 5 minutes or so when the cast assumes Travis' &quot;fake&quot; roles to get his former buddy to sound uncredible

Those 5 minutes were fine; the other 18 minutes or so of the show was boring

And while the Turkey one was a classic

there was 1 episode I would have loved to be one here

The one where Carlson ran for city council against some creep they found out had a drinking problem

This show had probably the greatest Les Nessman line of all time: when they found out the drunk opponent had fallen into his dinner at a convention honoring Armenian Americans (or something like that)

Les said &quot;Why are Armenians eating Lasagne

&quot; Anyone who eats lasagne with me for the rest of my life will hear that

regardless of whether they've seen the show or not

Totally irrelevant and off the wall -- just like the entire series

In terms of the tape

the line of the show has to go to Venus

In the pilot

when mamma learns of the format change and the emergence of Dr

Johnny Fever

she is flabbergasted

wondering what next

Venus then walks in shouting

&quot;Andy

my man

&quot; A







Buy the tape

even if you've never seen the show

You will

like me

wonder where good t

v

went
