Firstly

allow me to write that I have never read Victor Hugo's masterpiece \"Les Miserables

\" Therefore

I cannot judge the quality of this film adaptation against the novel

although I do know the basic plot of the novel

(There is some mischaracterization in this production

as there likely will be in any 130 minute film based upon a very long novel

)However

I did find the film adaptation relatively interesting

For the most part

the acting was good

I believe the main element of plot (i

e

the revenge story) was covered adequately

I would personally recommend the French \"Les Miserables\" miniseries staring Gerald Depardieu (who also plays in another French-language miniseries entitled \"Le Compte of Monte Cristo\")

Although it is not perfect

it is better than any other adaptation of which I am currently aware

[However

my knowledge of French films based on classic novels is far less than my knowledge of British or American films based on classic novels of British or American literature

]As of December 2009

the French \"Les Miserables\" miniseries is NOT available in the U

S

DVD market (i

e

the Region 1 market)

(However

one could purchase the film from Amazon

fr

especially if one has an international account and a Region 2 DVD player

)I will provide the link to the amazon

fr \"Les Miserables\" page under \"Comments
