I will not waste my or your time with an overblown descriptive review of this movie

but I would just like to reiterate that's it's a great film

If more films were this intelligent and riveting

there'd be a lot more memorable movies worth throwing your coin at

even to purchase your own copy of because this one is definitely rewatchable

If you enjoyed the style of \"Glengarry Glenn Ross\" check this movie out for sure

or vice versa

If these aren't the type of films that keep you on the edge of your seat

by all means

continue stock piling your Will Smith/Tom Cruise action movies
