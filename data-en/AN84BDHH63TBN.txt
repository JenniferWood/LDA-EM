This is an action-packed robbers on the run film in the model of Carl Franklin's One False Move

but while Franklin's film had a tightly-woven plot

here there were two many subplots and predictable scenes

Keifer Sutherland is





well

Keifer Sutherland

He never plays against type

as the hardcore villain

and this role is no exception

Still

there are more twists than a licorice whip

and the film takes us through a grisly robbery and chase that thankfully omits the cliches of similar films

Outstanding performance from Myketi Williams

Recommended for fans of such fare
